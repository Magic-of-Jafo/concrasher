## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Modify/Create (after refactor):
    - `src/app/organizer/conventions/page.tsx` (New main management page)
    - `src/app/organizer/conventions/ConventionList.tsx` (Helper component)
    - `src/app/organizer/conventions/ConventionActions.tsx` (Helper component)
    - `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (Corrected Edit page path)
    - `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/new/page.tsx` (Create page)
    - `src/components/ConventionForm.tsx` (Shared form component)
    - `src/app/api/organizer/conventions/[id]/route.ts` (API for individual convention actions - GET/PUT/DELETE)
    - `src/app/api/organizer/conventions/[id]/restore/route.ts` (API for restore)
    - `src/app/api/organizer/conventions/all-conventions/route.ts` (API for fetching all cons for client page)
    - `src/middleware.ts` (For route protection)
    - `src/lib/auth.ts`
    - `src/lib/utils.ts` (For `generateShortRandomId`)
    - `prisma/schema.prisma` (If schema changes are needed, e.g., `deletedAt`)
    // Potentially other API routes if not covered by the above: /api/conventions/:id/duplicate, /api/conventions/:id/status
  - Files Deleted/Old Locations:
    - `src/app/conventions/manage/*` (Old management page and components)
    - `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/page.tsx` (Old card layout page)
    - `src/app/organizer/conventions/manage/*` (Intermediate refactor location, now moved up)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React (`~18.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router)
  - Material UI (`~5.x`)
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - Auth.js (`~v4.x`)
  - React Query (`~4.x`)
  - Jest (`~29.x`)
  - Playwright (`~1.x`)

- **UI Components:**
  - Material UI:
    - `DataGrid` (with accessibility enhancements)
    - `IconButton` (with proper labels)
    - `Dialog` (with keyboard support)
    - `Snackbar` (with accessibility)
    - `Button` (with proper states)
    - `Checkbox` (with proper labels)
    - `Menu` (with keyboard navigation)
  - Custom:
    - Enhanced convention list
    - Improved action buttons
    - Mobile-friendly dialogs

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`

- **CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT SETUP NOTE:**
  - **IMPORTANT:** The project has experienced issues with the `.env.local` file. Before starting development:
    1. Verify that `.env.local` exists in the project root
    2. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set
    3. If any variables are missing or incorrect, check with the team for the correct values
    4. After making changes to `.env.local`, restart the development server
  - **CRITICAL PRISMA NOTE:** When executing Prisma CLI commands, you MUST use dotenv-cli to ensure the `.env.local` file is loaded:
    ```bash
    # Correct way to run Prisma commands:
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma db seed
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
    ```
    This is required because Prisma CLI does not automatically load variables from `.env.local`.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use TypeScript for all components
  - Follow Material UI theming
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use React Server Components where appropriate
  - Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
  - Use React Query for data fetching
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Use optimistic updates for better UX
  - Add proper error logging
  - Implement proper mobile-first design
