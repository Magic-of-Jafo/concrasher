# Story 2.8: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor – Pricing Tab

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context
To allow convention organizers to define pricing tiers and date-based discounts for their conventions through the new tabbed editor interface. This involves creating the UI, integrating with backend APIs for data persistence, and ensuring robust state management and validation.

## Requirements
- **Pricing Tab UI**: A dedicated tab within the `ConventionEditorTabs` component.
- **Price Tiers Section**:
  - Add, edit (label, amount), remove, and reorder (drag-and-drop) price tiers.
  - Each tier has a label (e.g., "Adult", "Youth") and a price.
  - Tier data should be saved to the database, associated with the convention.
- **Price Discounts Section**:
  - Add, edit, and remove discount date groups.
  - Each discount date group has a cutoff date.
  - For each date group, organizers can set a discounted price for any existing price tier.
  - Discount data (date, tier ID, discounted amount) saved to the database.
  - Discounts should only be configurable after price tiers have been saved.
- **State Management**: Robust state management for all form fields within the tab.
- **Data Validation**: Input validation for tier labels, amounts, dates, and discount amounts (e.g., using Zod).
- **API Integration**: Call appropriate server actions or API routes to save and load pricing data.
- **UI Feedback**: Clear feedback to the user for save operations, errors, etc. (e.g., using `notistack`).
- **Tab Persistence**: The currently selected tab (e.g., Pricing) should be remembered across page refreshes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Organizer can create, update, delete, and reorder price tiers for a convention.
- Organizer can create, update, and delete discount date groups with associated tier discounts.
- All pricing data is correctly saved to the database.
- Data is correctly loaded and pre-populated when editing an existing convention's pricing.
- User receives appropriate feedback for actions and errors.
- Input validation prevents invalid data from being submitted.
- The active tab state is preserved on page refresh.
- Deleting a price tier also deletes any associated discounts for that tier.
- Deleting a discount date group correctly removes all discounts associated with that specific date.
- Timezone issues with date pickers and database storage are handled correctly.

## Technical Context & Constraints
- **Framework**: Next.js, React
- **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI), @mui/x-date-pickers
- **Drag & Drop**: @hello-pangea/dnd
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Data Validation**: Zod
- **API Layer**: Next.js API Routes or Server Actions, Prisma ORM
- **Styling**: MUI's styling solution (e.g., `sx` prop, `styled` API)

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [X] Implement state management for form fields.
  - [X] Implement data fetching to pre-populate the form if editing an existing convention.

- [X] **Parent Tab Integration**
  - [X] Add PricingTab to `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` and ensure correct tab navigation.
  - [X] Ensure parent page(s) handle saving/loading pricing data.

- [X] **API/Server Action Integration**
  - [X] Implement Server Action(s) or API route logic for creating/updating pricing data.
  - [X] Ensure correct API endpoint(s) are called from the tab.

- [X] **Testing**
  - [X] Write unit tests for `PricingTab.tsx` and Zod schemas.
  - [ ] Write integration tests for the form submission and data saving flow (mocking APIs).
  - [ ] Write E2E tests for creating and editing the "Pricing" tab.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** Gemini (agile-test session)
- **Completion Notes:** 
  - Implemented the `PricingTab.tsx` component for managing Price Tiers and Price Discounts.
  - Price Tiers: 
    - Support for adding, editing (label, amount), removing, and reordering (drag-and-drop) tiers.
    - Tier saving API (`PUT /api/conventions/[id]/pricing/tiers`) refactored for true upserts (preserving existing tier IDs on update) and deletes, preventing unintended discount deletion.
  - Price Discounts:
    - UI for adding discount date groups and setting discounted amounts per tier for each date.
    - Implemented immediate deletion of an entire discount date group (and its associated discounts in the database) via its trash icon by calling a new `DELETE /api/conventions/[id]/pricing/discounts-by-date` API endpoint.
    - The main "Save Price Discounts" button utilizes an API (`PUT /api/conventions/[id]/pricing/discounts`) which performs a delete-all-for-convention-then-recreate strategy for the submitted discounts.
  - Tab Persistence: The active tab in `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` (including the Pricing tab) is now persisted in `localStorage` and restored on page refresh.
  - Addressed various UI/UX issues, including button enablement and extensive timezone handling for discount date creation, display, and deletion to ensure consistency between UI and database (UTC).
  - Added `notistack` for user feedback (requires installation and `SnackbarProvider` setup by the user).
  - Unit tests for Zod schemas related to pricing (`PriceTierSchema`, `PriceDiscountSchema`, `PricingTabSchema`) have been created and are passing.
- **Change Log:**  
  - Initial Draft
  - Status: In-Progress (implicitly by starting work)
  - Implemented Price Tier creation, UI, and initial save API (delete-all-create-new strategy).
  - Added Price Discount UI state management and save API (delete-all-create-new strategy).
  - Resolved API path conflicts and updated `conventionId` to `id` in API routes.
  - Refactored Price Tier save API for true upserts/deletes, preserving IDs.
  - Implemented immediate deletion of Price Discount Date Groups via new API endpoint.
  - Implemented tab persistence in `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx`.
  - Added unit tests for Zod pricing schemas.
  - Extensive debugging and refinement of date/timezone handling for discount creation, display, saving (PUT), and deletion (DELETE by date group) to ensure correct UTC storage and local time representation.
  - Status: Review (after initial fixes)
  - Status: Done (after final approval on date handling and deletion)

#### QA Notes (From User)
- Initial save of Price Tiers and Price Discounts (using main save buttons) works.
- Drag-and-drop reordering of Price Tiers works and saves correctly.
- Adding multiple Discount Date Groups works.
- Deleting Discount Date Groups via trash icon now correctly removes from UI and database, and does not reappear on refresh.
- Dates selected in UI for discounts are stored correctly as UTC in the database and displayed accurately in the UI on reload.
- Active tab (Pricing) is remembered after page refresh.
- UI enhancement: Regular price shown next to tier label in discount section.

- **Testing Guidance:** PASS – Unit, integration, and E2E test requirements specified.

**Project Structure Alignment:**  
All components, logic, and tests are mapped to the correct locations per `docs/project-structure.md`. No structural conflicts identified.

**Deviations:**  
None at this time. If API or data model constraints are discovered during implementation, update this section.

**Required User Decisions:**  
- Confirm if pricing can be updated independently or only as part of the full convention object.
- Confirm if currency selection is handled in the Settings tab or should be included here.
