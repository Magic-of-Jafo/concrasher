# Story 2.1: Convention Data Model & Basic CRUD API Endpoints

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** Technical Story - To ensure the `Convention` data model in Prisma (as defined in `docs/data-models.md` but primarily by this story's requirements) is complete, including all necessary attributes (name, dates, location, description, organizer, series link, status, image URLs), and implement basic API endpoints (Next.js API Routes at `/api/conventions`) for CRUD operations, initially accessible only by users with the `ADMIN` role for testing and setup.

**Context:** This story is the first in Epic 2: Convention Listing & Discovery. It lays the groundwork for managing convention data by defining the core `Convention` model and providing initial administrative API access. It builds upon the user and role systems established in Epic 1.

## Detailed Requirements

- Verify/Create the `ConventionStatus` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma`: (`DRAFT`, `UPCOMING`, `ACTIVE`, `PAST`, `CANCELLED`).
- Verify/Create the `Convention` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Key fields:
    - `id String @id @default(cuid())`
    - `name String`
    - `slug String @unique` (auto-generated from name if possible, or manually set)
    - `startDate DateTime`
    - `endDate DateTime`
    - `city String`
    - `state String`
    - `country String`
    - `venueName String?`
    - `description String? @db.Text`
    - `websiteUrl String?`
    - `organizerUserId String` (linking to `User.id`)
    - `organizer User @relation("OrganizedBy", fields: [organizerUserId], references: [id])`
    - `conventionSeriesId String?` (optional link to `ConventionSeries.id`)
    - `conventionSeries ConventionSeries? @relation(fields: [conventionSeriesId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)` (Note: `ConventionSeries` model is not defined in this story but the relation should be set up)
    - `status ConventionStatus`
    - `bannerImageUrl String?`
    - `galleryImageUrls String[] @default([])`
    - `createdAt DateTime @default(now())`
    - `updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt`
- Implement basic, protected Next.js API Routes (e.g., under `/api/conventions` and `/api/conventions/[id]`):
    - `POST /api/conventions` (Create)
    - `GET /api/conventions` (List all - basic, no pagination/filtering for this story)
    - `GET /api/conventions/{id}` (Get one by ID or slug)
    - `PUT /api/conventions/{id}` (Update by ID or slug)
    - `DELETE /api/conventions/{id}` (Delete by ID or slug)
- Initial protection: Only users whose `session.user.roles` array (from Auth.js) includes `ADMIN` can access these API endpoints.
- All data interactions must use Prisma Client.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Prisma schema for the `ConventionStatus` enum and the `Convention` model (including its relations to `User` as organizer and optionally `ConventionSeries`) is finalized and migrations apply successfully. The `Convention` model includes `name`, `slug`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `venueName`, `description`, `websiteUrl`, `organizerUserId`, `conventionSeriesId` (optional), `status`, `bannerImageUrl`, `galleryImageUrls`.
- AC2: An `ADMIN` user (verified by Auth.js session and `User.roles`) can successfully create a new convention listing via the `POST /api/conventions` API endpoint, with data persisted via Prisma.
- AC3: An `ADMIN` user can retrieve a list of all conventions and a single convention by its ID (or slug) via the respective `GET` API endpoints, with data fetched via Prisma.
- AC4: An `ADMIN` user can update an existing convention listing via the `PUT /api/conventions/{id}` API endpoint, with changes persisted via Prisma.
- AC5: An `ADMIN` user can delete a convention listing via the `DELETE /api/conventions/{id}` API endpoint, with the record removed/marked by Prisma.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `prisma/schema.prisma` (Add `ConventionStatus` enum and `Convention` model)
    - `src/app/api/conventions/route.ts` (For `POST` to create, `GET` to list all)
    - `src/app/api/conventions/[id]/route.ts` (For `GET` one, `PUT` update, `DELETE` one by `id` or `slug`)
    - Potentially `src/lib/validators.ts` to add Zod schemas for Convention creation/update.
  - Files to Read:
    - `docs/epic2.md` (This story's source requirements)
    - `docs/data-models.md` (For general reference, noting that Story 2.1 definition for Convention might be more current)
    - `src/lib/auth.ts` (For understanding admin role checks, `authOptions`)
    - `src/lib/db.ts` (For Prisma client instance)
    - `docs/coding-standards.md`
    - `docs/project-structure.md`

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router, API Route Handlers)
  - TypeScript (`~5.x`)
  - Auth.js (`~v4.x` for session/role checking)
  - Zod (for request body validation in API routes)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`):
    - `db.convention.create()`
    - `db.convention.findMany()`
    - `db.convention.findUnique()`
    - `db.convention.update()`
    - `db.convention.delete()`
  - Auth.js: Use `getServerSession(authOptions)` or `getToken({ req })` in API route handlers to get the current user's session and roles for Admin authorization.
  - Zod: To validate request bodies for `POST` and `PUT` operations. Define a schema for convention creation/update.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Not applicable. This story is API-focused.

- **Data Structures:**
  - `ConventionStatus` enum: `DRAFT`, `UPCOMING`, `ACTIVE`, `PAST`, `CANCELLED`.
  - `Convention` model as detailed in Requirements.
  - Zod schema for convention creation/update (e.g., `ConventionCreateSchema`, `ConventionUpdateSchema`).

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `DATABASE_URL` (used by Prisma)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (used by Auth.js)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (used by Auth.js)
  (These are existing variables)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - API Route handlers in `src/app/api/conventions/**/route.ts`.
  - All API handlers must perform an Admin role check using `session.user.roles.includes(Role.ADMIN)`.
  - Use Zod for validating incoming request bodies.
  - Generate a unique `slug` for conventions, perhaps from the `name` (e.g., using a utility like `slugify`). Ensure it's unique.
  - Relation to `ConventionSeries` is optional and the `ConventionSeries` model itself is not part of this story.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test Zod validation schemas for convention creation/update.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test each API route handler (`POST`, `GET` list, `GET` by ID, `PUT`, `DELETE`):
    - Mock Prisma client calls.
    - Mock `getServerSession` or `getToken` to simulate:
        - Authenticated Admin user.
        - Authenticated Non-Admin user (should be rejected).
        - Unauthenticated user (should be rejected).
    - Verify correct HTTP status codes and response bodies for success and error cases.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Scenario 1 (Admin CRUD Operations):
    1. (Setup) Ensure an Admin user exists.
    2. (Create) Admin user sends a `POST` request to `/api/conventions` with valid data. Verify 201 Created and convention data in response. Check DB.
    3. (Read List) Admin user sends a `GET` request to `/api/conventions`. Verify 200 OK and the created convention is in the list.
    4. (Read One) Admin user sends a `GET` request to `/api/conventions/{id}` (using ID from step 2). Verify 200 OK and correct convention data.
    5. (Update) Admin user sends a `PUT` request to `/api/conventions/{id}` with updated data. Verify 200 OK and updated data in response. Check DB.
    6. (Delete) Admin user sends a `DELETE` request to `/api/conventions/{id}`. Verify 200 OK (or 204 No Content). Check DB that it's removed.
  - Scenario 2 (Non-Admin Access Denied):
    1. (Setup) Ensure a Non-Admin user exists.
    2. Attempt `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` to convention endpoints as Non-Admin. Verify 403 Forbidden (or 401 if unauthenticated).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_convention_model_and_status` and inspect `schema.prisma` and database structure.
  - Use tools like Postman or `curl` to manually test API endpoints with an Admin user's credentials/token.

## Deviations from Epic / Future Considerations

- The `Convention` model defined in this story is based on the explicit requirements of Story 2.1. Further refinements and additions to the `Convention` model fields as per broader project needs or updated `docs/data-models.md` should be addressed in a subsequent dedicated story (e.g., Story 2.X).
- The `ConventionSeries` model is referenced but not defined in this story. Its definition and linkage will be part of a future story.
- Pagination, advanced filtering, and sorting for the `GET /api/conventions` endpoint are deferred to Story 2.4. This story implements a basic "list all" for Admin use.
- The `slug` field generation strategy (e.g., auto-generated from name vs. manually provided) needs to be decided and implemented. If auto-generated, ensure uniqueness.
