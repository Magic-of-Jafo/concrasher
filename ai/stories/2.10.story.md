# Story 2.10: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Talent Tab (NEW)

**Status:** Deferred (Blocked - Requires Epic 4, Story 4.1: Talent Profile Creation)

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an Organizer, I want to use the "Talent" tab to search for and link existing Talent profiles from the platform to my convention, so that featured performers and lecturers are showcased.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 2, Phase 2, focusing on enhancing the convention management system with a comprehensive tabbed editor. It builds upon the foundational data models (Story 2.6, including `TalentProfile` and `ConventionTalent`) and the existing `ConventionEditorTabs` component structure (established in Stories 2.7-2.9). This story will create the "Talent" tab.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement the "Talent" tab UI within the existing `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` component.
- **Search Functionality:**
    - Provide an autocomplete search input field (e.g., Material-UI `Autocomplete`) for Organizers to find existing Talent profiles on the platform.
    - Search should query `TalentProfile` records, potentially by `displayName` and `skills`.
    - Display search results clearly, showing `displayName` and `profilePictureUrl` (if available) to help identify the correct Talent.
- **Linking Talent:**
    - Allow the Organizer to select a Talent profile from the search results to link them to the current convention.
    - On selection, a `ConventionTalent` record should be prepared for saving, linking the `conventionId` and the selected `talentProfileId`.
- **Displaying Linked Talent:**
    - Once linked, display the Talent in a list or grid within the tab.
    - Each linked Talent item should show key information such as `displayName`, `profilePictureUrl` (or a placeholder), and potentially `tagline`.
    - Provide a "Remove" or "Unlink" action (e.g., an icon button) for each linked Talent.
- **Removing Linked Talent:**
    - Allow the Organizer to remove a previously linked Talent profile from the convention.
    - This should mark the corresponding `ConventionTalent` record for deletion or directly remove it.
- **Data Handling:**
    - The tab should fetch and display already linked `TalentProfile` records (via `ConventionTalent`) when editing an existing convention.
    - Changes (new links, removed links) should be collected and made available for the parent `ConventionEditorPage` to handle during the main save operation.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Organizer can search for platform Talent by `displayName` and/or `skills` using an autocomplete interface in the "Talent" tab.
- AC2: Organizer can select Talent from search results and link them to the convention; these linked Talent are displayed in the tab with their `displayName` and `profilePictureUrl`.
- AC3: Organizer can remove/unlink Talent from the convention, and they are removed from the display in the tab.
- AC4: All linked Talent data (associations) are correctly loaded and pre-populated when editing an existing convention.
- AC5: Changes to Talent links (additions/removals) are correctly saved to the backend when the convention is saved.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/TalentTab.tsx` (New: Main component for this tab)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `src/app/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (or the shared `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` component): To integrate the new `TalentTab` and handle its data.
        - `src/lib/actions.ts` (or new API routes): To implement server-side logic for searching talent profiles and for fetching/updating `ConventionTalent` associations.
            - Example search function: `searchTalentProfiles(query: string): Promise<TalentProfile[]>`
            - Example update function: `updateConventionTalent(conventionId: string, talentIds: string[]): Promise<void>`
        - `src/lib/validators.ts`: Potentially add a schema for the data structure managed by this tab if complex (e.g., an array of talent IDs).
    - Files to Read:
        - `docs/epic2.md` (Story 2.10 requirements)
        - `docs/data-models.md` (For `TalentProfile` and `ConventionTalent` model definitions)
        - `prisma/schema.prisma` (To confirm `TalentProfile`, `ConventionTalent` models)
        - `docs/project-structure.md`
        - `docs/coding-standards.md`
        - `docs/ui-ux.md` (For UI guidance on Autocomplete, Chips/Cards for display)
        - `ai/stories/2.9.story.md` (For reference on implementing a tab and integrating with parent editor page)

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Next.js (App Router, Server Actions or API Routes)
    - React (Hooks for state management)
    - Material UI (MUI) (for `Autocomplete`, `Chip`, `Card`, `IconButton`, `Avatar` components)
    - Prisma (for database interaction with `TalentProfile` and `ConventionTalent`)
    - Zod (if validation schemas are needed for tab data)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage / Server Actions:**
    - **Talent Search:**
        - An API route (e.g., `GET /api/talent/search?q={query}`) or a Server Action `searchTalentProfiles(query: string)` that uses Prisma to query `TalentProfile` by `displayName` (case-insensitive contains) and `skills` (array contains).
        - Returns a list of `TalentProfile` objects (or a subset of fields like `id`, `displayName`, `profilePictureUrl`, `tagline`).
    - **Fetching Linked Talent:**
        - The parent `ConventionEditorPage` when loading convention data should include `ConventionTalent` relations, which in turn include `TalentProfile` details.
    - **Updating Linked Talent:**
        - When the convention is saved, the list of `talentProfileId`s associated with the convention should be sent to a Server Action or API route (e.g., `PUT /api/conventions/{conventionId}/talent-links`).
        - This action/route will reconcile the new list of talent IDs with existing `ConventionTalent` records for the given `conventionId` (creating new links, deleting old ones).

- **Data Structures:**
    - `TalentProfile` (Prisma model): `id`, `displayName`, `profilePictureUrl`, `tagline`, `skills`.
    - `ConventionTalent` (Prisma model): `conventionId`, `talentProfileId`.
    - Frontend state for the tab might include:
        - `searchQuery: string`
        - `searchResults: TalentProfile[]`
        - `linkedTalent: TalentProfile[]` (or an array of objects containing `TalentProfile` data and the `ConventionTalent` link ID if needed for updates).

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Standard variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, etc.)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Ensure the search functionality is efficient and doesn\'t overload the backend (e.g., debounce search input).
    - Provide clear UI feedback for search (loading/no results) and linking/unlinking actions.

## Deviations from Epic / Prerequisites

- Assumes `TalentProfile` and `ConventionTalent` models are fully defined and migrated as per `docs/data-models.md` and referenced in Story 2.6.
- Assumes a system for users to obtain the `TALENT` role and create their `TalentProfile` exists (likely from Epic 1).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test the `TalentTab.tsx` component:
        - Rendering of search input and display area for linked talent.
        - State updates on search input change.
        - Mocked search functionality and display of results.
        - Simulating talent selection and adding to the linked list.
        - Simulating talent removal from the linked list.
    - Test any Server Action or API route utility functions for searching talent or updating links (mocking Prisma calls).
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test `TalentTab.tsx` component's interaction with actual (mocked backend) search calls.
    - Test data fetching and pre-population of linked talent when editing a convention.
    - Test the flow of data from the tab to the parent editor for saving.
- **API Route/Server Action Tests (if creating new ones):**
    - Test the `searchTalentProfiles` action/route for correct querying and result formatting.
    - Test the `updateConventionTalent` action/route for correct creation/deletion of `ConventionTalent` records.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
    - Full user flow: Organizer navigates to the "Talent" tab for a new/existing convention.
    - Searches for talent by name and/or skill.
    - Selects multiple talent from search results and links them. Verifies they appear in the "linked talent" section.
    - Removes some linked talent.
    - Saves the convention and verifies talent links are persisted correctly by reloading the editor and/or checking a (mocked or test) database.
    - Verifies linked talent are displayed correctly when re-editing.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Prerequisite Check:**
    - [ ] Confirm `TalentProfile` and `ConventionTalent` models are in `prisma/schema.prisma` and match `docs/data-models.md`.
    - [ ] Confirm mechanism for `User` to have `TALENT` role and `TalentProfile` data exists.
- [ ] **Backend: Talent Search Logic**
    - [ ] Create Server Action (e.g., `searchTalentProfiles(query: string)`) or API route (`GET /api/talent/search`) using Prisma to search `TalentProfile` by `displayName` and `skills`.
    - [ ] Ensure it returns necessary fields (e.g., `id`, `displayName`, `profilePictureUrl`, `tagline`).
- [ ] **Backend: Update Convention Talent Links**
    - [ ] Create Server Action (e.g., `updateConventionTalentLinks(conventionId: string, talentProfileIds: string[])`) or API route (`PUT /api/conventions/[conventionId]/talent-links`) to manage `ConventionTalent` records.
    - [ ] This action should compare the provided list of `talentProfileIds` with existing links for the convention and create/delete records as needed.
- [ ] **Component Development: `TalentTab.tsx`**
    - [ ] Create `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/TalentTab.tsx`.
    - [ ] Implement UI structure: MUI `Autocomplete` for search, area to display linked talent (e.g., list of MUI `Card` or `Chip` components).
    - [ ] Implement state management for search query, search results, and list of currently linked talent.
    - [ ] Implement search input handling (with debouncing) calling the backend search logic.
    - [ ] Implement logic to add selected talent to the `linkedTalent` state.
    - [ ] Implement logic to remove talent from the `linkedTalent` state.
    - [ ] Display linked talent with `displayName`, `profilePictureUrl` (or placeholder avatar), `tagline` and a remove button.
- [ ] **Parent Tab Integration:**
    - [ ] Integrate `TalentTab.tsx` into `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` (or `src/app/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx`).
    - [ ] Ensure parent page fetches existing `ConventionTalent` data and passes it to `TalentTab.tsx`.
    - [ ] Ensure parent page retrieves the list of linked `talentProfileId`s from `TalentTab.tsx` upon save and calls the backend update logic.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `TalentTab.tsx` and backend logic.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for component and backend interactions.
    - [ ] Write E2E tests for the complete user flow.
