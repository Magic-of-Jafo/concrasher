# Story 2.9: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Venue/Hotel Tab (NEW)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an Organizer, I want to use the "Venue/Hotel" tab to provide detailed information about the primary event venue and any associated guest hotels, including addresses, contacts, images, amenities, and group rates, so attendees have comprehensive lodging and location information.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 2, Phase 2, focusing on enhancing the convention management system with a comprehensive tabbed editor. It builds upon Story 2.6 (which should define the necessary `Venue` and `Hotel` data models) and Story 2.7 & 2.8 (which implemented the "Basic Info & Series" and "Pricing" tabs). This story will create the "Venue/Hotel" tab within the `ConventionEditorTabs` component.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement the "Venue/Hotel" tab UI within the existing `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` component.
- **Primary Venue Section:**
    - Fields for: Venue Name, Full Address (Street, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country), Contact Person (Name, Email, Phone), Website URL, Notes/Description (Text Area).
    - Image upload for Venue Photos (multiple images with captions, similar to media tab).
    - List of Amenities (checkboxes or multi-select, e.g., "Wi-Fi", "Stage", "AV Equipment", "Accessible").
- **"Guests Staying at Venue?" Logic:**
    - A checkbox: "Tick if guests will NOT be staying at this Primary Venue location."
    - If checked, the "Primary Hotel Information" section (below) is hidden or disabled.
    - If unchecked (default), "Primary Hotel Information" section is visible and applicable.
- **Primary Hotel Information Section (Conditional):**
    - This section is for hotel details specifically at the Primary Venue location (if guests can stay there).
    - Fields for: Hotel/Room Block Name (if different from Venue Name), Group Rate/Booking Code, Booking Link, Cut-off Date for booking.
    - Specific hotel-related amenities (e.g., "Restaurant On-site", "Pool", "Gym").
- **Additional Hotels Section (Dynamic List):**
    - Ability to dynamically add/edit/remove "Additional Hotel" entries.
    - Each "Additional Hotel" entry should have fields for: Hotel Name, Full Address, Contact Person, Website URL, Group Rate/Booking Code, Booking Link, Cut-off Date, Notes, Amenities.
    - Image upload for each Additional Hotel (multiple images with captions).
- **Location & Access Information Section:**
    - Fields for: Parking Information (Text Area), Public Transportation Access (Text Area), Accessibility Notes for the overall location (Text Area).
- **State Management:** Use React hooks for managing form state within the tab.
- **Data Validation:** Implement client-side validation (e.g., using Zod) for required fields, valid URLs, and dates.
- **API Integration:**
    - The tab should fetch existing Venue/Hotel data when editing a convention.
    - On save (likely handled by the parent `ConventionEditorPage`), data from this tab should be sent to the backend to create/update `Venue` and `Hotel` records associated with the `Convention`.
- **UI Feedback:** Standard UI feedback for save operations, errors, etc. (handled by parent or with `notistack`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Organizer can input all details for Primary Venue (name, address, contact, website, notes, amenities, images) and save them.
- AC2: The checkbox logic for "Guests will NOT be staying at this Primary Venue" correctly shows/hides the "Primary Hotel Information" section, and data is saved appropriately based on this choice.
- AC3: If guests can stay at the primary venue, Organizer can input and save specific hotel details (room block name, group rate, booking link, cut-off date, hotel amenities) for the Primary Hotel.
- AC4: Organizer can dynamically add, edit, and remove multiple Additional Hotels, each with its own full set of details (name, address, contact, website, rate, link, cut-off, notes, amenities, images), and this data is saved.
- AC5: Organizer can input and save Location & Access Information (Parking, Transport, Accessibility).
- AC6: All form fields have appropriate client-side validation.
- AC7: All venue and hotel data (Primary Venue, Primary Hotel (if applicable), Additional Hotels, Location/Access Info) is correctly loaded and pre-populated when editing an existing convention.
- AC8: Data is correctly structured and saved to the backend, associating `Venue` and `Hotel` records with the `Convention`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create/Modify:
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/VenueHotelTab.tsx` (New: Main component for this tab)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/PrimaryVenueForm.tsx` (New: Sub-component for primary venue details)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/HotelForm.tsx` (New: Reusable sub-component for hotel details - Primary & Additional)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/LocationAccessForm.tsx` (New: Sub-component for location/access info)
        - `src/lib/validators.ts` (Modify: Add Zod schemas for Venue and Hotel data)
        - `src/app/api/conventions/[id]/venues/route.ts` (New: API route for managing convention venues - POST, PUT, DELETE)
        - `src/app/api/conventions/[id]/hotels/route.ts` (New: API route for managing convention hotels - POST, PUT, DELETE)
        - Parent component `src/app/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` or `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` will need to integrate this tab and handle data fetching/saving orchestration.
    - Files to Read:
        - `docs/epic2.md` (Story 2.9 requirements)
        - `docs/data-models.md` (Expected `Venue`, `Hotel` models and relations to `Convention`)
        - `prisma/schema.prisma` (To confirm `Venue`, `Hotel` models from Story 2.6)
        - `docs/project-structure.md`
        - `docs/coding-standards.md`
        - `docs/ui-ux.md` (For general UI/UX guidance, especially forms and dynamic lists)
        - `ai/stories/2.6.story.md` (For `Venue`/`Hotel` model definitions and API expectations)
        - `ai/stories/2.8.story.md` (For reference on implementing a tab with dynamic lists, e.g., `PricingTab.tsx`)

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Next.js (App Router, API Routes or Server Actions)
    - React (Hooks for state management)
    - Material UI (MUI) (for UI components, forms, icons)
    - Prisma (for ORM and database interaction)
    - Zod (for data validation)
    - `@hello-pangea/dnd` (if reordering of additional hotels is desired, though not explicitly required by ACs)
    - `notistack` (for user feedback, likely already integrated)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Frontend will call new API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/conventions/{conventionId}/venues`, `PUT /api/conventions/{conventionId}/venues/{venueId}`, `POST /api/conventions/{conventionId}/hotels`, etc.) to save venue and hotel data.
    - These APIs will use Prisma client to interact with `Venue` and `Hotel` tables.
    - Image uploads will follow the existing pattern (e.g., presigned URLs from a dedicated API endpoint, direct upload to object storage).

- **Data Structures:**
    - Zod schemas for `VenueCreateSchema`, `VenueUpdateSchema`, `HotelCreateSchema`, `HotelUpdateSchema`.
    - TypeScript interfaces for `Venue` and `Hotel` data (should align with Prisma models from Story 2.6).
    - Form state will likely involve arrays for multiple images and multiple additional hotels.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Standard variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, etc.)
    - Variables for object storage if image uploads are part of this story's direct implementation (though likely uses existing image upload infra).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Component structure should be modular (e.g., `PrimaryVenueForm`, `HotelForm`).
    - Ensure robust error handling and clear user feedback.

## Deviations from Epic / Prerequisites

- **CRITICAL PREREQUISITE:** This story heavily relies on the `Venue` and `Hotel` data models (and their relations to `Convention`) being defined and migrated. ~~as part of **Story 2.6: Upgrade Convention Data Model & Core APIs for Advanced Features**.~~
    - ~~As of the last check, `prisma/schema.prisma` did **not** contain these specific `Venue` and `Hotel` models. It only had `venueName: String?` on the `Convention` model.~~
    - ~~**This story cannot be fully implemented without Story 2.6 completing the schema changes for `Venue` and `Hotel` entities.** The API endpoints and form structures detailed below assume these models exist as rich entities, not just simple string fields.~~
    - **UPDATE:** The `Venue` and `Hotel` Prisma models, along with `VenuePhoto` and `HotelPhoto`, have been defined directly as part of this story and migrated. The `docs/reference/venue-hotel-data-structure.md` file details these models.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test Zod validation schemas for Venue and Hotel data.
    - Test individual form components (`PrimaryVenueForm.tsx`, `HotelForm.tsx`, `LocationAccessForm.tsx`) for state changes, input handling, and validation display (mocking API calls).
    - Test any utility functions specific to this tab.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the `VenueHotelTab.tsx` component's integration with its child form components.
    - Test data fetching and pre-population of forms when editing an existing convention (mocking API responses for venue/hotel data).
    - Test the interaction flow for adding/editing/removing "Additional Hotels".
    - Test the conditional rendering logic based on the "Guests staying at Venue?" checkbox.
- **API Route/Server Action Tests (if creating new ones):**
    - Test the new API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting venue and hotel records, ensuring correct Prisma client usage, data validation, and authorization.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
    - Full user flow: Organizer navigates to the "Venue/Hotel" tab for a new/existing convention.
    - Fill in Primary Venue details, including image uploads and amenities.
    - Test the "Guests staying at Venue?" checkbox logic and fill in Primary Hotel details accordingly.
    - Add, edit, and remove several "Additional Hotels" with full details and images.
    - Fill in Location & Access information.
    - Save the convention and verify all venue/hotel data is persisted correctly by reloading the editor and/or checking a (mocked or test) database.
    - Verify data validation errors are shown correctly for invalid inputs.
