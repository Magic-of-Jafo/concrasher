# Story 2.2: Organizer - Create Convention Listing Form & Submission

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** As an Organizer (a user with the `ORGANIZER` role), I want a comprehensive form (built with React and Material UI) to create a new convention listing with all relevant details, so that I can accurately present my event to the community.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 2.1's foundation of the `Convention` data model and basic CRUD API endpoints. It focuses on creating the user interface that allows Organizers to create new convention listings, leveraging the existing API infrastructure while adding role-based access control and form validation.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a new page/route for the convention creation form (e.g., `/conventions/new` or `/organizer/conventions/new`).
- Implement role-based access control:
  - Only users with `ORGANIZER` role (verified via Auth.js session) can access this page
  - Redirect unauthorized users to an appropriate page (e.g., home or login)
- Build a comprehensive form using Material UI components that includes fields for all `Convention` model attributes:
  - Name (required)
  - Start Date (required)
  - End Date (required)
  - City (required)
  - State (required)
  - Country (required)
  - Venue Name (optional)
  - Description (optional, rich text editor)
  - Website URL (optional)
  - Banner Image (optional, file upload)
  - Gallery Images (optional, multiple file upload)
  - Status (required, defaults to `DRAFT`)
  - Convention Series (optional, dropdown of series the organizer manages)
- Implement form validation:
  - Client-side validation using React Hook Form with Zod schemas
  - Server-side validation using the same Zod schemas
  - Show clear error messages for invalid fields
- Handle image uploads:
  - For banner and gallery images, implement the strategy from TS3
  - Get presigned URLs from the server
  - Upload files to object storage
  - Save final URLs in the form data
- Form submission:
  - On submit, call the `POST /api/conventions` endpoint
  - Automatically set `organizerUserId` to the current user's ID
  - If a `ConventionSeries` is selected, set `conventionSeriesId`
  - Show loading state during submission
  - Handle success/error states appropriately
- Navigation:
  - After successful creation, redirect to the new convention's detail page
  - Provide a way to cancel and return to the previous page

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A user with the `ORGANIZER` role can access the convention creation form. Users without this role are redirected.
- AC2: The form includes all required fields from the `Convention` model, with appropriate input types and validation.
- AC3: Form validation works correctly:
  - Required fields cannot be empty
  - Dates are valid and end date is after start date
  - URLs are properly formatted
  - Error messages are clear and field-specific
- AC4: Image uploads work correctly:
  - Banner image can be uploaded and previewed
  - Multiple gallery images can be uploaded and previewed
  - Upload progress is shown
  - Failed uploads are handled gracefully
- AC5: On successful submission:
  - A new `Convention` record is created in the database
  - The `organizerUserId` is correctly set to the current user
  - If selected, the `conventionSeriesId` is correctly set
  - Image URLs are saved correctly
  - User is redirected to the new convention's detail page
- AC6: Error handling:
  - Network errors are handled gracefully
  - Validation errors are shown clearly
  - Server errors are displayed appropriately
  - Form state is preserved on error

- **Environment Setup Notes:**
  - **IMPORTANT:** The project has experienced issues with the `.env.local` file. Before starting development:
    1. Verify that `.env.local` exists in the project root
    2. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set
    3. If any variables are missing or incorrect, check with the team for the correct values
    4. After making changes to `.env.local`, restart the development server

## Deviations from Epic / Future Considerations

- Rich text editor implementation details are left to the developer's discretion, but should support basic formatting.
- Image upload strategy assumes TS3's approach of using presigned URLs and object storage.
- Form layout and styling should follow Material UI best practices but specific design details are flexible.
- Error message wording and styling can be refined based on user feedback.
