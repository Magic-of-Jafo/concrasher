# Story 2.11: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Schedule Tab (NEW)

**Status:** In-Progress

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an Organizer, I want to use the highly interactive "Schedule" tab to visually build my convention's schedule by creating detailed event cards, assigning types, defining locations and fees, and arranging them on a drag-and-drop timeline that supports simultaneous events, so that I can easily manage and present a complex schedule.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 2, Phase 2, introducing the "Schedule" tab to the `ConventionEditorTabs` component. It builds on foundational data models from Story 2.6 (specifically `ConventionScheduleItem`, `ScheduleEventFeeTier`, and the definitions for `ScheduleEventTalentLink` and `ScheduleEventBrandLink`). The UI/UX for linking Talent and Brands to schedule items is deferred (see Deviations section).

## Implementation Paradigm & Key Decisions

This section documents the collaborative decisions and implementation paradigm for Story 2.11, serving as a living reference for all contributors. All major requirements, edge cases, and technical strategies are captured here and reflected in the implementation and acceptance criteria below.

### 1. Front Page and Navigation
- The homepage uses a modern, responsive layout with a top menu bar (MUI), showing the site name (linked to homepage), login/logout/profile logic, and a "Dashboard" link for organizers.
- The homepage features a Product Hunt-style convention feed with a sidebar for future widgets, using a custom layout (not MUI Grid v1) to avoid deprecation warnings.
- Convention cards display event details and are fully clickable; the "Learn More" button was removed for simplicity, and vertical spacing was tightened.

### 2. Convention Feed Enhancements
- The homepage shows conventions sorted by start date, hides past events, and displays a status label ("Happening Now!", "In X Days", etc.) using robust time calculations ported from the `/conventions` page.
- All time calculations are robust and the feed is accessible and visually clear.

### 3. Schedule Tab Planning and Requirements
- The Schedule Tab is a highly interactive, accessible drag-and-drop timeline/calendar for event scheduling, supporting overlapping events, event card CRUD, and fee tiers.
- Implementation is structured: confirm data models, implement backend CRUD, build components bottom-up (event card, form, timeline, tab), ensure accessibility, and document all decisions in the story file.
- The story file is used as a living requirements and implementation scratchpad, with detailed notes for each component and key decision.

### 4. Fee Tiers and Display Logic
- `ScheduleEventFeeTier` represents extra fees for specific events.
- Fee information is only shown if the amount is non-zero; otherwise, events are assumed included in registration. This is enforced in both backend and frontend logic.

### 5. Talent/Brand Linkage
- All UI/UX for linking Talent and Brand profiles to schedule items is deferred until Epic 4, as those account types are not yet available. Only the underlying data models are assumed to exist.

### 6. Venue/Location Logic
- If an event is at the Primary Venue, only the room name is shown (no link).
- If at a Secondary Venue, the venue name is a clickable link to its detail page. Organizer selects between Primary (room name) and Secondary Venue (dropdown + optional room) when creating/editing an event.
- Backend: Each event stores `locationName` (room/custom), and `venueId` (nullable; if present, links to a venue). If `venueId` is null, event is at the Primary Venue.

### 7. Drag-and-Drop/Timeline Technology
- `dnd-kit` is used for a custom Kanban-style timeline grid, supporting drag, resize, overlap, and full accessibility.
- The timeline supports stacking/offsetting of overlapping events and robust keyboard accessibility.

### 8. Data Model Prerequisites
- `ConventionScheduleItem` and related models are defined in docs but must be added to the actual Prisma schema. This is a prerequisite for backend and frontend work.

### 9. Time and Duration Handling
- Only `startTime` and `endTime` are stored in the database (UTC). Duration is always calculated on the frontend as needed, to avoid inconsistencies.

### 10. Documentation and Story File Usage
- All major decisions, edge cases, and implementation notes are documented in this section and throughout the story file. The story file is the single source of truth for requirements and technical context for this feature.

### 3b. ScheduleDay Table for Timeline Management (May 2024)
- We are introducing a new `ScheduleDay` table to explicitly persist each timeline day for a convention.
- On initialization, a `ScheduleDay` record is created for each day from the convention's start to end date (inclusive), with sequential `dayOffset` values (0, 1, 2, ...).
- Organizers can add extra days before or after the official range (with `dayOffset` < 0 or > max), but can only remove extra days if they are empty (no events).
- Official days (created at initialization) cannot be deleted via the UI, even if the convention is shortened; this ensures no accidental data loss. Organizers must manually reschedule/cancel events on extra days.
- Swapping days is supported (e.g., drag-and-drop or arrows), and after any add/remove/swap, all `dayOffset` values are re-sequenced to be contiguous and unique.
- This approach enables robust, user-friendly schedule editing, clear UI, and future extensibility (e.g., day-level settings, labels, or notes).

### Timeline UI Details (May 2024)
- The timeline will display a default viewable window (e.g., 8am–10pm), with clickable time slots for event scheduling.
- "Scroll Up" and "Scroll Down" buttons (or similar controls) will be provided at the top and bottom of this window.
- Clicking these buttons will jump the timeline to show earlier or later time ranges (e.g., 12am–8am or 10pm–12am), allowing access to the full 24-hour day without cluttering the default view.
- The click-to-schedule logic will remain consistent across all visible time ranges.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement the "Schedule" tab UI within the existing `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` component.
- **Visual Timeline/Calendar Interface:**
    - Display a visual timeline or calendar view (e.g., daily or multi-day views based on convention duration).
    - Allow Organizers to drag and drop "Event Cards" onto this timeline to set their start time.
    - Allow resizing of Event Cards on the timeline to set their duration.
    - The interface must visually support and manage simultaneous/overlapping events.
- **Event Card Creation & Editing:**
    - Provide a mechanism (e.g., a modal dialog or a drawer) to create and edit `ConventionScheduleItem` details.
    - Fields for: Event Name/Title, Event Type (e.g., Workshop, Panel, Performance, Tournament - potentially with a free-text option for custom types), Description.
    - Location: Ability to select from Venues/Hotels defined in Story 2.9, or specify a custom room/location name (e.g., "Main Stage", "Room 101B").
    - Fees: Ability to define multiple fee tiers for the event (e.g., "Standard Entry: $10", "VIP Access: $25"). This will create/update `ScheduleEventFeeTier` records linked to the `ConventionScheduleItem`.
    - (**Deferred UI:** Linking Talent and Brands to the event card will be handled in a future story, likely related to Epic 4, Story 4.7. The underlying data models `ScheduleEventTalentLink` and `ScheduleEventBrandLink` are assumed to exist from Story 2.6).
- **Event Card Management:**
    - Allow duplication of existing Event Cards to quickly create similar events.
    - Allow deletion of Event Cards.
- **Data Handling:**
    - Fetch and display existing `ConventionScheduleItem` data (including their fee tiers) when editing a convention.
    - All schedule data (event details, times, durations, locations, fees) must be correctly structured and saved to the backend.
- **Accessibility:** The drag-and-drop interface must be accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA), providing keyboard alternatives for all actions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Organizer can create `ConventionScheduleItem` (Event Cards) with details: Name, Type, Description, Location (from Venue/Hotel list or custom), and multiple Fee Tiers.
- AC2: Event Cards can be dragged and dropped onto a visual timeline; Start Time and Duration (via resizing) are correctly determined and saved to the database.
- AC3: The timeline interface correctly displays and allows management of simultaneous/overlapping schedule events.
- AC4: Event Cards can be duplicated (creating a new record with copied details) and deleted (removing the record).
- AC5: All `ConventionScheduleItem` data, including `ScheduleEventFeeTier` data, loads correctly for editing when an existing convention schedule is viewed.
- AC6: The drag-and-drop interface and all event management functions are accessible via keyboard and meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
- AC7: (**Deferred UI**) The UI for linking Talent and Brands to schedule items is not implemented in this story.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ScheduleTab.tsx` (New: Main component for this tab)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ScheduleEventCard.tsx` (New: Component for individual event cards)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ScheduleEventForm.tsx` (New: Modal/Drawer form for creating/editing event details)
        - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ScheduleTimelineView.tsx` (New: Component for the visual D&D timeline)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `src/app/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (or shared `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx`): To integrate `ScheduleTab.tsx`.
        - `src/lib/actions.ts` (or new API routes): For CRUD operations on `ConventionScheduleItem` and `ScheduleEventFeeTier`.
        - `src/lib/validators.ts`: Add Zod schemas for `ConventionScheduleItemCreateSchema`, `ConventionScheduleItemUpdateSchema`, `ScheduleEventFeeTierSchema`.
    - Files to Read:
        - `docs/epic2.md` (Story 2.11 requirements)
        - `docs/data-models.md` (For `ConventionScheduleItem`, `ScheduleEventFeeTier`, `ScheduleEventTalentLink`, `ScheduleEventBrandLink` model definitions. Assume links exist per Story 2.6 even if UI is deferred.)
        - `prisma/schema.prisma` (To confirm schedule-related models)
        - `docs/project-structure.md`
        - `docs/coding-standards.md`
        - `docs/ui-ux.md` (For UI guidance on complex forms, D&D interfaces, modals)
        - `ai/stories/2.8.story.md` (Reference for drag-and-drop for reordering Price Tiers; consider using a similar library/approach for consistency, e.g., `@hello-pangea/dnd` or `dnd-kit` if suitable for timeline D&D).
        - `ai/stories/2.9.story.md` (For reference on implementing a tab with dynamic lists and forms).

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Next.js (App Router, Server Actions or API Routes)
    - React (Hooks for state management)
    - Material UI (MUI) (for UI components, `Dialog`, forms, icons)
    - Prisma (for ORM)
    - Zod (for data validation)
    - **Drag-and-Drop Library:** A library like `@hello-pangea/dnd` or `dnd-kit` will likely be needed for the visual timeline functionality. Evaluate based on suitability for timeline/calendar D&D and accessibility features. Story 2.8 (Pricing Tab) used D&D for reordering; developer should review that implementation for consistency.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage / Server Actions:**
    - Server Actions or API routes for full CRUD on `ConventionScheduleItem` records, including nested CRUD for `ScheduleEventFeeTier` records.
    - Logic to handle batch updates if multiple schedule items are modified before a save.

- **Data Structures:**
    - `ConventionScheduleItem` (Prisma model): `id`, `conventionId`, `title`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `locationName`, `description`, `order`, plus relations for fee tiers (and talent/brand links - though UI deferred).
    - `ScheduleEventFeeTier` (Prisma model): `id`, `scheduleItemId`, `label`, `amount`.
    - Zod schemas for validating these structures.
    - Frontend state will be complex, managing multiple event cards, their positions/durations on the timeline, and the state of any open editing forms.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - The Schedule Tab is described as "highly interactive" and the "most complex UI component" in `docs/ui-ux.md`.
    - Consider a palette of creatable event types if applicable.
    - Ensure clear visual feedback during drag, drop, and resize operations.
    - Modal/Drawer for event editing should be comprehensive but not overwhelming.
    - Accessibility for D&D is paramount (WCAG 2.2 AA).

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Standard variables.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Modularity will be key for managing complexity (e.g., `ScheduleEventCard`, `ScheduleEventForm`, `ScheduleTimelineView`).

## Deviations from Epic / Prerequisites

- **Deferred Functionality:** The UI/UX for linking Talent and Brands to individual `ConventionScheduleItem` event cards is **DEFERRED**. This functionality is anticipated to be covered after Talent Profiles (Epic 4, Story 4.1/4.2) and Brand Profiles (Epic 4, Story 4.4/4.5) are implemented, likely as part of Story 4.7 or a dedicated follow-up story.
    - The underlying data models (`ScheduleEventTalentLink`, `ScheduleEventBrandLink`) are assumed to be defined in Prisma (as per Story 2.6 requirements) to allow for future integration.
- Assumes `ConventionScheduleItem` and `ScheduleEventFeeTier` models are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` as per Story 2.6.
- Assumes Venues/Hotels can be fetched (from Story 2.9) to populate location selection options.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `ScheduleEventCard.tsx` for correct rendering of event details.
    - Test `ScheduleEventForm.tsx` for input handling, validation (mocked), and state changes for event details and fee tiers.
    - Test `ScheduleTimelineView.tsx` for basic rendering (D&D logic might be harder to unit test in isolation, focus on event rendering).
    - Test utility functions for time/date calculations or schedule data manipulation.
    - Test Zod validation schemas.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test `ScheduleTab.tsx`'s integration of `ScheduleTimelineView` and `ScheduleEventForm`.
    - Test creation, update, and deletion of schedule events and their fee tiers through the UI, mocking backend calls.
    - Test drag-and-drop and resize functionalities by asserting changes to underlying data state (mocking persistence).
    - Test data fetching and pre-population of the schedule for an existing convention.
- **API Route/Server Action Tests:**
    - Test CRUD operations for `ConventionScheduleItem` and nested `ScheduleEventFeeTier` records, ensuring correct Prisma client usage and data validation.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
    - Full user flow: Organizer navigates to "Schedule" tab.
    - Creates multiple event cards with full details (name, type, desc, location, multiple fee tiers).
    - Drags and drops events onto the timeline, verifies start times.
    - Resizes events on the timeline, verifies durations.
    - Creates overlapping/simultaneous events and verifies display.
    - Duplicates an event and edits it.
    - Deletes an event.
    - Saves the convention and verifies all schedule data (including fee tiers, times, locations) is persisted by reloading the editor.
    - Verifies keyboard accessibility for all D&D operations and event management.

## Component Notes

### Fee Tier Display Logic
- Fee tiers (`ScheduleEventFeeTier`) should only be displayed to site visitors if the amount is non-zero.
- By default, events are assumed to be included in the convention registration price unless a non-zero fee is specified.

### Venue/Location Display Logic
- If an event is at the Primary Venue, only the room name is shown (no link).
- If an event is at a Secondary Venue, the venue name is shown as a clickable link to the venue's detail page, with optional room name.
- Organizer selects between Primary (room name) and Secondary Venue (dropdown + optional room) when creating/editing an event.
- Backend: Each event stores `locationName` (room/custom), and `venueId` (nullable; if present, links to a venue). If `venueId` is null, event is at the Primary Venue.

### Talent/Brand Linkage (Deferred)
- All UI/UX for linking Talent and Brand profiles to schedule items is **deferred** in this story, as those account types are not available until Epic 4.
- Only the underlying data models are assumed to exist for future integration.

### Timeline/D&D Technology Choice
- **Library:** `dnd-kit` will be used for all drag-and-drop functionality (event card placement, resizing) in the schedule timeline.
- **Timeline Display:** A custom Kanban-style timeline grid will be implemented. This provides a horizontal time axis, with event cards visually stretched to represent their duration.
- **Overlap/Simultaneous Events:** The custom timeline will support stacking or vertical offsetting of overlapping event cards.
- **Interactivity:** Users can drag to move events (change start time) and resize events (change duration).
- **Rationale:** `dnd-kit` offers maximum control over UI/UX, accessibility, and ensures consistency with other D&D features in the application. Building a custom timeline allows us to tailor the experience precisely to our needs for both organizer editing and attendee display.

### Time/Duration Storage Logic
- Only `startTime` and `endTime` (both UTC) will be stored for each event.
- Duration (in minutes and decimal hours) will always be calculated on the frontend as needed, never stored in the database.
- This avoids data inconsistency between start/end and duration.
