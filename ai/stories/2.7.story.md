# Story 2.7: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Basic Info & Series Tab

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an Organizer, I want to use the "Basic Info & Series" tab within the new convention editor to manage core details like series linkage, convention name, comprehensive date handling (including one-day & TBD options), location, descriptions, and primary images, so that the fundamental identity of my event is clearly defined.

**Context:** This story is the first UI implementation step for the new 8-tab advanced convention editor, building upon the upgraded data models and core APIs established in Story 2.6. It focuses on creating the "Basic Info & Series" tab, which handles the foundational details of a convention.

## Detailed Requirements

- Convention Series selection/creation.
- Convention Name (for slug generation).
- Start/End Date fields with "One-Day Event" toggle & TBD/blank date logic.
- City/State/Country selection.
- Main/Short Description fields.
- Cover/Profile Image Uploads.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Organizer can access and interact with all fields and controls in the "Basic Info & Series" tab.
- AC2: All data entered (series link, name, dates with TBD/one-day logic, location, descriptions, images) is correctly saved to the expanded data model via the new/updated APIs (from Story 2.6).
- AC3: Form validations specific to this tab (e.g., required name, valid dates, valid image types/sizes) are functional, providing clear feedback.
- AC4: Existing data for this tab is correctly loaded when editing a convention.
- AC5: Image uploads are functional, storing images to the designated object storage and linking them to the convention record.
- AC6: Convention Series can be selected from an existing list (fetched via API) or a new series can be created (triggering an API call to create the series and then linking it).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify (Likely):
    - `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/new/page.tsx` (To host the new tabbed editor)
    - `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (To host the new tabbed editor, loading existing data)
    - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` (New parent component for the 8-tab structure)
    - `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/BasicInfoTab.tsx` (New component for this story's tab content and logic)
    - `src/components/ui/ImageUploader.tsx` (Potentially a new or enhanced reusable image uploader component)
    - `src/lib/validators.ts` (Add/update Zod schemas for Basic Info & Series tab fields)
    - `prisma/schema.prisma` (Verify fields from Story 2.6 like `coverImageUrl`, `profileImageUrl`, `seriesId` on `Convention` model and `ConventionSeries` model are adequate)
  - API Routes to Use/Verify (from Story 2.6):
    - `POST /api/organizer/conventions` (For creating a new convention, potentially an initial draft from this tab)
    - `PUT /api/organizer/conventions/[id]` (For updating convention with data from this tab)
    - `GET /api/organizer/conventions/[id]` (For fetching existing convention data for this tab)
    - `GET /api/convention-series` (To list existing series for selection)
    - `POST /api/convention-series` (To create a new series)
    - API endpoints for handling image uploads (e.g., generating presigned URLs if using S3/Cloudinary directly, or a dedicated backend route).

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React (`~18.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router, Server Actions for mutations)
  - Material UI (`~5.x`): `Tabs`, `Tab`, `TextField`, `Button`, `DatePicker` (from `@mui/x-date-pickers`), `Autocomplete`, `Switch`, `Box`, `CircularProgress`.
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - React Query (`~4.x`) or SWR/Server Actions for data fetching and mutations.
  - Zod (`~3.x`) for validation.
  - Cloud Object Storage SDK (e.g., AWS S3 SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) or Cloudinary SDK, as per `docs/api-reference.md` and `docs/environment-vars.md`).

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Fetch existing convention data (if editing) using `GET /api/organizer/conventions/[id]`.
  - Save convention data (create/update) using `POST /api/organizer/conventions` or `PUT /api/organizer/conventions/[id]`. This should handle the "Basic Info & Series" fields. Consider if the API supports partial updates per tab.
  - Fetch list of `ConventionSeries` using `GET /api/convention-series`.
  - Create new `ConventionSeries` using `POST /api/convention-series`.
  - Handle image uploads:
    - This might involve a client-side request to a presigned URL (obtained from a backend API endpoint) or a direct upload through a backend API route that streams to S3/Cloudinary.
    - Store the resulting image URL(s) (e.g., `coverImageUrl`, `profileImageUrl`) in the `Convention` model.

- **UI/UX Notes:** (Refer to `docs/ui-ux.md#screen--view-name-1-convention-editor-page-multi-tab-interface`)
  - The "Basic Info & Series" tab is the first tab in the `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` component.
  - Layout should include distinct sections for:
    - Convention Series: Autocomplete for selection, button/modal for creation.
    - Core Details: Convention Name (`TextField`).
    - Dates: `DatePicker` for Start/End Dates, `Switch` for "One-Day Event", `Switch` for "Dates TBD". Implement logic for TBD (disables date pickers, clears dates) and One-Day (sets end date to start date).
    - Location: `TextField` for City, State, Country (consider `Autocomplete` for State/Country if predefined list is available/desirable).
    - Descriptions: `TextField` (multiline) for Main Description, `TextField` (multiline) for Short Description.
    - Imagery: Two `ImageUploader` components for Cover Image and Profile Image. Show previews, allow removal/replacement. Indicate recommended dimensions/aspect ratios. Show progress during upload.

- **Data Structures:** (Refer to `docs/data-models.md` and ensure Prisma schema from Story 2.6 is sufficient)
  - `Convention` model fields: `name` (String), `slug` (String, auto-generated from name), `startDate` (DateTime?), `endDate` (DateTime?), `isOneDayEvent` (Boolean), `isTBD` (Boolean), `city` (String), `state` (String), `country` (String), `descriptionShort` (String?), `descriptionMain` (String?), `coverImageUrl` (String?), `profileImageUrl` (String?), `seriesId` (String?, FK to `ConventionSeries`).
  - `ConventionSeries` model fields: `name` (String), `description` (String?).
  - Zod schemas in `src/lib/validators.ts` for validating the inputs of this tab.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (if needed for constructing API URLs client-side)
  - Cloud storage related variables as per `docs/environment-vars.md` (e.g., `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_S3_REGION` if using S3 and presigned URLs generated client-side or by an API route).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Component naming: `BasicInfoTab.tsx`, `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx`.
  - Use Server Actions for form submissions and data mutations where feasible.
  - Ensure all form controls are accessible (labels, ARIA attributes).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests (Jest & RTL):**
  - Test `BasicInfoTab.tsx` component:
    - Correct rendering of all form fields and controls.
    - State updates correctly on user input.
    - Validation logic (mocking Zod schema validation) and display of error messages.
    - Correct behavior of "One-Day Event" and "Dates TBD" toggles.
    - Interaction with `ImageUploader` components (mocking upload functionality).
    - Correct invocation of save/submit functions with appropriate data.
    - Correct pre-population of form fields when existing data is provided.
  - Test `ImageUploader.tsx` component (if new/enhanced):
    - File selection, preview rendering, upload initiation (mocked), error handling for types/sizes.
  - Test Zod validation schemas in `src/lib/validators.ts` for this tab.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the `BasicInfoTab.tsx` saving data through its parent `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` or page:
    - Mock API calls (`/api/organizer/conventions`, `/api/convention-series`, image upload endpoints).
    - Verify correct data payload is sent to APIs upon form submission.
    - Verify form behavior on API success/error responses (e.g., notifications, redirect).
  - Test interaction with Convention Series `Autocomplete` and creation modal/flow, ensuring series are fetched and new ones can be (mock) created and selected.

- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Full user flow for an Organizer filling out the "Basic Info & Series" tab for a new convention and saving it.
  - Full user flow for loading an existing convention, modifying data in the "Basic Info & Series" tab, and saving changes.
  - Test image upload functionality (uploading a test image and verifying it's displayed/referenced).
  - Verify client-side and server-side validation messages appear correctly for invalid inputs.
  - Ensure accessibility of all form elements (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [X] **Project Setup & Prerequisite Verification:**
  - [X] Confirm API endpoints from Story 2.6 (`/api/organizer/conventions/[id]`, `/api/convention-series`) are ready and support the required fields for this tab.
  - [X] Confirm Prisma schema (`Convention`, `ConventionSeries`) includes all necessary fields (e.g., `coverImageUrl`, `profileImageUrl`, `seriesId`, date booleans). Run `npx prisma generate`.
  - [X] Set up necessary environment variables for image storage if not already done.

- [ ] **Component Development: `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` (Parent Structure)**
  - [X] Create `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ConventionEditorTabs.tsx`.

  - [X] This component will likely manage the overall convention data state (or receive it via props) and handle the master save/submit logic that calls the API. (State management for BasicInfoTab added, save button added, API call now handled by parent page via onSave prop)

- [ ] **Component Development: `BasicInfoTab.tsx`**
  - [X] Create `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/BasicInfoTab.tsx`.
  - [X] Implement form layout using Material UI components for all fields specified in UI/UX Notes.
    - [X] Convention Series: `Autocomplete` to fetch and select from `/api/convention-series`, plus a button to trigger new series creation (modal or separate form section). (Note: Functionality moved to page level, UI in tab removed)
    - [X] Convention Name: `TextField`.
    - [X] Dates: `DatePicker` controls, `Switch` for "One-Day Event", `Switch` for "Dates TBD". Implement conditional logic.
    - [X] Location: `TextField` components for City, State, Country.
    - [X] Descriptions: `TextField` (multiline) components.
  - [X] Implement state management for form fields (e.g., `useState` or `useForm` hook if using a form library).
  - [X] Implement data fetching to pre-populate the form if editing an existing convention (passed as prop).

- [ ] **Component Development: `ImageUploader.tsx` (If needed)**
  - [ ] Create or enhance `src/components/ui/ImageUploader.tsx`. (Deferred to Story 2.13 - Media Tab)
  - [ ] Implement file input, preview, validation (type, size), and upload logic (e.g., to presigned URL or backend API). (Deferred to Story 2.13 - Media Tab)
  - [ ] Display upload progress and error messages. (Deferred to Story 2.13 - Media Tab)
  - [ ] Integrate two instances into `BasicInfoTab.tsx` for Cover and Profile images. (Deferred to Story 2.13 - Media Tab)

- [x] **Data Handling & Validation**
  - [X] Define Zod validation schema in `src/lib/validators.ts` for the "BasicInfoTab" fields.
  - [X] Implement client-side validation using the Zod schema in `BasicInfoTab.tsx`.
  - [X] Implement Server Action(s) or API route logic for:
    - [X] Creating/Updating convention with "Basic Info & Series" data (excluding images).
    - [X] Creating a new `ConventionSeries`.

- [x] **Page Integration:**
  - [X] Modify `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/new/page.tsx` to render `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` for creating a new convention.
  - [X] Modify `src/app/(main)/organizer/conventions/[id]/edit/page.tsx` to fetch convention data and render `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` populated with this data.
  - [X] Implement logic for saving data from the tab (e.g., a "Save" button on the tab or within `ConventionEditorTabs` that triggers the API call handled by parent pages).

- [ ] **Testing:**
  - [X] Write unit tests for `BasicInfoTab.tsx` and Zod schemas.
  - [X] Write integration tests for the form submission and data saving flow (mocking APIs).
  - [X] Write E2E tests for creating and editing the "Basic Info & Series" tab.

- [X] **Documentation & Review:**
  - [X] Ensure all new components are adequately commented.
  - [X] Perform self-review against ACs and checklist.

## Deviations from Epic / Future Considerations
- The epic implies a monolithic save for the entire 8-tab editor. This story might implement per-tab save or a "save draft" for the whole editor that can be incrementally updated. This needs to be clarified with how `ConventionEditorTabs.tsx` handles overall state and submission. For this first tab, assume it contributes its data to a larger state object managed by `ConventionEditorTabs` or the page, which is then submitted.
- Slug generation from convention name should be handled server-side upon saving.
- Image upload functionality will be implemented in Story 2.13 (Media Tab) rather than in this story.
