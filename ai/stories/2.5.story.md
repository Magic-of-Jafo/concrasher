# Story 2.5: Convention Listing Management

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** As a convention organizer, I want to manage my convention listings (edit, delete, duplicate, change status) so that I can maintain and update my convention information efficiently.

**Context:** This story builds upon Stories 2.1-2.4, which established the Convention model, creation form, detail page, and search functionality. Now we'll implement the management features that allow organizers to maintain their convention listings.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a convention management interface with the following features:
  - List view of organizer's conventions
  - Quick actions for each convention:
    - Edit convention details
    - Delete convention
    - Duplicate convention
    - Change status (PUBLISHED, DRAFT, etc.)
  - Bulk actions for multiple conventions:
    - Bulk delete
    - Bulk status change
    - Bulk export
  - Sorting and filtering options:
    - Sort by date, status, name
    - Filter by status, type
  - Pagination for large lists
- Implement edit functionality:
  - Reuse convention creation form
  - Pre-populate form with existing data
  - Validate changes
  - Show success/error messages
- Add delete functionality:
  - Confirmation dialog
  - Soft delete option
  - Recovery mechanism
- Implement duplicate feature:
  - Copy all convention details
  - Generate new unique ID
  - Set status to DRAFT
  - Allow immediate editing
- Add status management:
  - Status change confirmation
  - Status-specific validations
  - Status change history
- Implement bulk operations:
  - Select multiple conventions
  - Apply bulk actions
  - Show progress indicators
  - Handle partial failures

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `src/app/conventions/manage/page.tsx` (management page)
    - `src/app/conventions/manage/ConventionList.tsx` (list component)
    - `src/app/conventions/manage/ConventionActions.tsx` (actions component)
    - `src/app/conventions/manage/BulkActions.tsx` (bulk operations)
    - `src/lib/api.ts` (add/update API functions)
    - `src/lib/convention.ts` (convention utilities)
  - Files to Read:
    - `docs/epic2.md` (This story's source requirements)
    - `docs/data-models.md` (For Convention model details)
    - `docs/coding-standards.md`
    - `docs/project-structure.md`
    - `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React (`~18.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router)
  - Material UI (`~5.x`)
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - Auth.js (`~v4.x` for session/role checking)
  - React Query (`~4.x` for data fetching)

- **UI Components:**
  - Material UI:
    - `DataGrid` for convention list
    - `IconButton` for actions
    - `Dialog` for confirmations
    - `Snackbar` for notifications
    - `Button` for bulk actions
    - `Checkbox` for selection
    - `Menu` for status options
  - Custom:
    - Convention list component
    - Action buttons component
    - Bulk actions toolbar
    - Status change dialog

- **Data Structures:**
  - Convention management type
  - Bulk action type
  - Status change type
  - Action history type

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for API calls)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (for Prisma)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (for Auth.js)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (for Auth.js)

- **Environment Setup Notes:**
  - **IMPORTANT:** The project has experienced issues with the `.env.local` file. Before starting development:
    1. Verify that `.env.local` exists in the project root
    2. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set
    3. If any variables are missing or incorrect, check with the team for the correct values
    4. After making changes to `.env.local`, restart the development server
  - **CRITICAL PRISMA NOTE:** When executing Prisma CLI commands, you MUST use dotenv-cli to ensure the `.env.local` file is loaded:
    ```bash
    # Correct way to run Prisma commands:
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma db seed
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
    ```
    This is required because Prisma CLI does not automatically load variables from `.env.local`.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use TypeScript for all components
  - Follow Material UI theming
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use React Server Components where appropriate
  - Follow accessibility guidelines
  - Use React Query for data fetching
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Use optimistic updates for better UX

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

  - Test convention list component
  - Test action handlers
  - Test bulk operations
  - Test status management
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test API integration
  - Test data flow
  - Test state management
  - Test error handling

    3. Save changes
    4. Verify updates
  - Scenario 2 (Delete Convention):
    1. Select convention to delete
    2. Confirm deletion
    3. Verify removal
    4. Check recovery
  - Scenario 3 (Bulk Actions):
    1. Select multiple conventions
    2. Apply bulk action
    3. Verify changes
    4. Check error handling
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Test all actions
  - Test bulk operations
  - Test error scenarios
  - Test accessibility
  - Test responsive design
