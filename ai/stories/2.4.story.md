# Story 2.4: Convention Listing Search & Filtering

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** As a user, I want to search and filter convention listings by various criteria (location, date range, type, etc.) so that I can easily find conventions that match my interests and requirements.

**Context:** This story builds upon Stories 2.1-2.3, which established the Convention model, creation form, and detail page. Now we'll implement the search and filtering functionality to help users discover relevant conventions.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a search and filter interface with the following features:
  - Search bar for text-based search (name, description, location)
  - Date range filter (start date, end date)
  - Location filter (country, state/province, city)
  - Convention type filter (multi-select)
  - Status filter (PUBLISHED, DRAFT, etc.)
  - Price range filter (if applicable)
  - Clear filters button
  - Apply filters button
- Implement search results display:
  - Grid/list view of matching conventions
  - Pagination or infinite scroll
  - Loading states while fetching results
  - Empty state when no results found
  - Error handling for failed searches
- Add URL-based filter state:
  - Update URL with current filters
  - Support sharing filtered results via URL
  - Handle browser back/forward navigation
- Implement responsive design:
  - Collapsible filter panel on mobile
  - Optimized layout for all screen sizes
  - Touch-friendly controls

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Search functionality works correctly:
  - Text search finds matches in name, description, and location
  - Search is case-insensitive
  - Search results update in real-time
  - Empty results are handled gracefully

  - Multiple filters can be combined
  - Filters can be cleared individually or all at once
  - Filter state persists across page refreshes
- AC3: Results display is correct:
  - Results are properly paginated
  - Loading states are shown during searches
  - Error states are handled appropriately
  - Empty states are informative
- AC4: URL integration works:

  - URLs can be shared and loaded
  - Browser navigation works correctly
- AC5: Responsive design is implemented:
  - Mobile layout is usable
  - Tablet layout is optimized
  - Desktop layout is efficient
  - Touch targets are appropriately sized

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `src/app/conventions/page.tsx` (main listing page)
    - `src/app/conventions/SearchFilters.tsx` (filter component)
    - `src/app/conventions/ConventionGrid.tsx` (results display)
    - `src/lib/api.ts` (add/update API functions)
    - `src/lib/search.ts` (search utilities)
  - Files to Read:
    - `docs/epic2.md` (This story's source requirements)
    - `docs/data-models.md` (For Convention model details)
    - `docs/coding-standards.md`
    - `docs/project-structure.md`
    - `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React (`~18.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router)
  - Material UI (`~5.x`)
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - Auth.js (`~v4.x` for session/role checking)
  - React Query (`~4.x` for data fetching)

- **UI Components:**
  - Material UI:
    - `TextField` for search input
    - `DatePicker` for date filters
    - `Select` for dropdown filters
    - `Chip` for active filters
    - `Button` for actions
    - `Grid` for layout
    - `Pagination` for results
    - `Drawer` for mobile filters
  - Custom:
    - Filter panel component
    - Results grid component
    - Loading skeleton component

- **Data Structures:**
  - Search parameters type
  - Filter state type
  - Search results type
  - Pagination metadata type

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for API calls)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (for Prisma)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (for Auth.js)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (for Auth.js)

- **Environment Setup Notes:**
  - **IMPORTANT:** The project has experienced issues with the `.env.local` file. Before starting development:
    1. Verify that `.env.local` exists in the project root
    2. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set
    3. If any variables are missing or incorrect, check with the team for the correct values
    4. After making changes to `.env.local`, restart the development server
  - **CRITICAL PRISMA NOTE:** When executing Prisma CLI commands, you MUST use dotenv-cli to ensure the `.env.local` file is loaded:
    ```bash
    # Correct way to run Prisma commands:
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma db seed
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
    ```
    This is required because Prisma CLI does not automatically load variables from `.env.local`.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use TypeScript for all components
  - Follow Material UI theming
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use React Server Components where appropriate
  - Follow accessibility guidelines
  - Use React Query for data fetching
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Use URL state management

## Testing Requirements

  - Test search utility functions
  - Test filter state management
  - Test URL parameter handling
  - Test pagination logic
- **Integration Tests:**

    3. Check result relevance
  - Scenario 2 (Filter Application):
    1. Apply multiple filters
    2. Verify results update
    3. Check filter persistence
  - Scenario 3 (URL Sharing):
    1. Apply filters
    2. Copy URL
    3. Open in new window
