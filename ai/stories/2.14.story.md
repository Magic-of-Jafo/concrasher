# Story 2.14: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Settings Tab (NEW)

**Status:** Complete

## Story

- As an Organizer
- I want to use the "Settings" tab to configure convention-specific options, such as the default currency for pricing and the primary timezone for the event schedule
- so that these are applied correctly throughout the listing

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC1**: Organizer can select and save the default currency for the convention
- **AC2**: Organizer can select and save the primary timezone for the convention  
- **AC3**: These settings are correctly referenced and applied in other relevant tabs (e.g., currency in Pricing, timezone for Schedule display)
