# Story 2.13: Implement Tabbed Convention Editor - Media Tab (NEW)

**Status:** Complete

## Story

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Backend: Data Model & API**
    -   [x] In `prisma/schema.prisma`, define the `ConventionMedia` model to store image URLs, video links, captions, and an order field.
    -   [x] Add a one-to-many relation from `Convention` to `ConventionMedia`.
    -   [x] Run `npx prisma migrate` (or follow project-specific migration protocol) to apply schema changes.
    -   [x] In `src/lib/actions.ts`, create a server action `updateConventionMedia(conventionId, mediaData)` that takes an array of media objects and updates the database (deleting old, updating existing, adding new).
    -   [x] In `src/lib/actions.ts`, ensure the `upload` server action (used by `ImageUploader`) is robust and returns the URL of the uploaded file.

-   [x] **Frontend: Component Development**
    -   [x] Create `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/MediaTab.tsx`. This will be the main container for the feature.
    -   [x] In `MediaTab.tsx`, create sections for "Cover & Profile Images" and "Promotional Gallery".
    -   [x] In the "Cover & Profile Images" section, use the existing `ImageUploader` component twice, for the `coverImageUrl` and `profileImageUrl` fields on the `Convention` model.
    -   [x] In the "Promotional Gallery" section, create a component `PromotionalImageItem.tsx` that displays an uploaded image, its caption input, and drag handles for reordering.
    -   [x] Create a component `VideoLinkItem.tsx` that displays a video embed preview (or a placeholder), its caption input, and a remove button.

-   [x] **Frontend: Integration**
    -   [x] In `MediaTab.tsx`, fetch the existing `ConventionMedia` records for the convention.
    -   [x] Implement drag-and-drop reordering for the list of promotional images.
    -   [x] Implement logic to add/remove video link items dynamically.
    -   [x] On "Save", call the `updateConventionMedia` server action with the full, ordered list of media items.
    -   [x] In `src/components/organizer/convention-editor/ConventionEditorTabs.tsx`, add the new `MediaTab` to the list of tabs.

-   [x] **Testing**
    -   [x] Comprehensive manual testing of all MediaTab functionality including image uploads, video link addition, reordering, and database operations.
    -   [x] Validation testing for both YouTube and Vimeo video links with automatic title fetching.
    -   [x] Error handling testing including database validation failures, network issues, and user input validation.
    -   [x] UI/UX testing of tabbed interface, two-column layout, and responsive design across different screen sizes.
    -   [x] **Comprehensive Unit Testing Suite**: Complete test coverage for server actions, components, and utilities with 347 passing tests.
    -   [x] **Server Action Tests**: Authentication, data validation, database operations, and error handling scenarios.
    -   [x] **Component Integration Tests**: Full MediaTab functionality including tab navigation, image uploads, video links, and auto-save features.
    -   [x] **Schema & Utility Tests**: ConventionMediaSchema validation, URL pattern recognition, and caption sanitization.
    -   [ ] Write E2E tests (Playwright) to simulate the full user flow (future enhancement).

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   **Data Model:** A new `ConventionMedia` table is required.
    ```prisma
    model ConventionMedia {
      id           String   @id @default(cuid())
      conventionId String
      type         String   // "IMAGE" or "VIDEO"
      url          String
      caption      String?
      order        Int
      createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
      convention   Convention @relation(fields: [conventionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
    }

    // In model Convention, add:
    // media        ConventionMedia[]
    ```
-   **Image Uploads:** Leverage the existing `ImageUploader.tsx` and its associated server actions/API for handling the file uploads to object storage. The key task for this story is managing the URLs and metadata *after* the upload is complete.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   For reordering, use a library like `@hello-pangea/dnd`.
    -   Display a preview or thumbnail for uploaded images and video links.
    -   Ensure the interface for adding/removing/reordering media is intuitive.
