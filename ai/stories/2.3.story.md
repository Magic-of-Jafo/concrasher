# Story 2.3: Convention Listing Detail Page

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a convention listing, including its description, dates, location, and images, so that I can learn more about the event and decide whether to attend.

**Context:** This story builds upon Stories 2.1 and 2.2, which established the Convention model and creation form. Now we'll create a public-facing detail page that displays all convention information in an organized and visually appealing way.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a new page/route for convention details (e.g., `/conventions/[id]` or `/conventions/[slug]`)
- Implement the detail page layout with the following sections:
  - Hero section with banner image and convention name
  - Key information section:
    - Dates (formatted nicely)
    - Location (city, state, country)
    - Venue name (if available)
    - Status badge (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, etc.)
  - Description section with rich text content
  - Image gallery (if images are available)
  - Website link (if available)
  - Convention series information (if part of a series)
- Add loading states and error handling:
  - Show loading skeleton while data is being fetched
  - Handle 404 cases for non-existent conventions
  - Display appropriate error messages for failed data fetches
- Implement responsive design:
  - Optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Ensure images are properly sized and optimized
  - Maintain readability across all screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The detail page loads and displays all convention information correctly:
  - All required fields are visible
  - Optional fields are shown when available
  - Data is properly formatted (dates, addresses, etc.)
- AC2: The page is responsive and works well on all screen sizes
- AC3: Loading states are implemented:
  - Skeleton loading while data is being fetched
  - Smooth transitions between states
- AC4: Error handling works correctly:
  - 404 page for non-existent conventions
  - Error messages for failed data fetches
  - Graceful fallbacks for missing optional data
- AC5: Images are displayed correctly:
  - Banner image is properly sized and positioned
  - Gallery images are displayed in a grid
  - Images are optimized for web
- AC6: Navigation works correctly:
  - Links to website open in new tab
  - Back button returns to previous page
  - Convention series link works (if applicable)

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `src/app/conventions/[id]/page.tsx` (or similar path)
    - `src/app/conventions/[id]/ConventionDetail.tsx` (main component)
    - `src/app/conventions/[id]/loading.tsx` (loading state)
    - `src/app/conventions/[id]/error.tsx` (error handling)
    - `src/lib/api.ts` (add/update API functions)
  - Files to Read:
    - `docs/epic2.md` (This story's source requirements)
    - `docs/data-models.md` (For Convention model details)
    - `docs/coding-standards.md`
    - `docs/project-structure.md`
    - `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React (`~18.x`)
  - Next.js (`~14.x` App Router)
  - Material UI (`~5.x`)
  - Prisma (`~5.x`)
  - Auth.js (`~v4.x` for session/role checking)

- **UI Components:**
  - Material UI:
    - `Card` for content sections
    - `Typography` for text elements
    - `Chip` for status badges
    - `Button` for actions
    - `Skeleton` for loading states
    - `Alert` for error messages
    - `ImageList` for gallery
  - Custom:
    - Hero section component
    - Image gallery component
    - Loading skeleton component

- **Data Structures:**
  - Convention detail response type
  - Image gallery data structure
  - Error response type

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for API calls)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (for Prisma)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (for Auth.js)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (for Auth.js)

- **Environment Setup Notes:**
  - **IMPORTANT:** The project has experienced issues with the `.env.local` file. Before starting development:
    1. Verify that `.env.local` exists in the project root
    2. Ensure all required environment variables are properly set
    3. If any variables are missing or incorrect, check with the team for the correct values
    4. After making changes to `.env.local`, restart the development server
  - **CRITICAL PRISMA NOTE:** When executing Prisma CLI commands, you MUST use dotenv-cli to ensure the `.env.local` file is loaded:
    ```bash
    # Correct way to run Prisma commands:
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma db seed
    npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
    ```
    This is required because Prisma CLI does not automatically load variables from `.env.local`.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use TypeScript for all components
  - Follow Material UI theming
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use React Server Components where appropriate
  - Follow accessibility guidelines
  - Use Next.js Image component for optimized images

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test data formatting functions
  - Test error handling components
  - Test loading state components
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test data fetching
  - Test error scenarios
  - Test navigation
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Scenario 1 (View Convention Details):
    1. Navigate to convention listing
    2. Click on a convention
    3. Verify all information is displayed correctly
    4. Test responsive layout
  - Scenario 2 (Error Handling):
    1. Try to access non-existent convention
    2. Verify 404 page
  - Scenario 3 (Loading States):
    1. Navigate to convention with slow network
    2. Verify loading states
    3. Verify smooth transition to content
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Test on different devices and screen sizes
  - Test with various image sizes and formats
  - Test with slow network conditions
  - Test accessibility features
