# Story 1.6: Admin Role - Initial Assignment & Basic Dashboard Placeholder

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** Technical Story - To provide a secure way to assign the "Admin" role to an initial user (via Prisma seed script) and create a basic, access-controlled placeholder page for an Admin Dashboard.

**Context:** Following the establishment of the user role system in Story 1.5, this story focuses on bootstrapping administrative access. It involves creating a Prisma seed script to assign the `ADMIN` role to a designated user and setting up a basic, route-protected admin dashboard page using Next.js middleware. This is essential for future admin-specific functionalities.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create or modify the Prisma seed script (`prisma/seed.ts`) to:
  - Accept an environment variable (e.g., `ADMIN_EMAIL`) specifying the email of the user to be designated as an admin.
  - Find the user with the specified email.
  - If the user exists, update their `roles` array to include `Role.ADMIN`. Ensure not to duplicate roles if already an admin.
  - Provide clear console output regarding its actions (e.g., "Admin role assigned to user@example.com" or "User user@example.com not found").
- Document how to run the seed script (e.g., in `README.md` or as a comment in the script itself) including setting the `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable.
- Create a simple placeholder page at `/admin/dashboard` (e.g., `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`). This page should simply state it's an admin area.
- Modify Next.js middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) to protect all routes under `/admin/*`:
  - It must check if the currently authenticated user's `session.user.roles` array (populated in Story 1.5) includes `Role.ADMIN`.
  - If the user is not an admin or is not authenticated, they should be redirected (e.g., to the login page or a generic "access denied" page / homepage).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: An `ADMIN` role can be successfully assigned to an existing user by running the Prisma seed script (`npx prisma db seed`) after setting an appropriate `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable.
- AC2: A user whose `session.user.roles` array includes `ADMIN` can successfully access the `/admin/dashboard` page.
- AC3: A user without the `ADMIN` role (e.g., a regular `USER` or an unauthenticated user) is redirected from `/admin/*` routes to a non-admin page (e.g., login page or homepage).
- AC4: The `/admin/dashboard` placeholder page displays basic content indicating it is an "Admin Area".

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` (Admin dashboard placeholder page).
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `prisma/seed.ts` (Script to assign `ADMIN` role).
    - `src/middleware.ts` (To protect `/admin/*` routes).
  - Files to Modify (Potentially):
    - `package.json`: Add/update the `prisma.seed` script if necessary (e.g., to use `tsx` or handle environment variables for the script, like `dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma db seed`). Standard `npx prisma db seed` typically handles `.env` loading for Prisma Client, but direct `process.env` access in the seed script might need `dotenv`.
    - `README.md`: Add instructions for using the seed script.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Prisma (for seed script, database interaction, `Role` enum)
  - Next.js (App Router for the page, Middleware for route protection)
  - Auth.js (NextAuth.js `~v4.x`): `getToken` (in middleware) or `getServerSession` (if middleware logic is complex and needs full session object) to access `session.user.roles`.
  - TypeScript

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`) in `prisma/seed.ts`:
    - `db.user.findUnique()` to find the user by email.
    - `db.user.update()` to add `Role.ADMIN` to the `roles` array.
  - Next.js Middleware API (`NextResponse` for redirects, `NextRequest` for request details).
  - Auth.js: `getToken({ req, secret })` is often preferred in middleware for efficiency if only JWT payload (including roles) is needed. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is available to middleware.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - The `/admin/dashboard` page is a simple placeholder (e.g., an `<h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>` and a short message).

- **Data Structures:**
  - `User.roles`: Array of `Role` enum. Ensure `Role.ADMIN` is used.
  - Environment variable for seed script: `ADMIN_EMAIL`.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: To be defined by the developer locally (e.g., in `.env` or `.env.local`) when running the seed script. This should NOT be committed if it contains a real email for a shared dev environment; instructions should clarify it's for local seeding or specific initial setup.
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Required by Auth.js `getToken` in middleware.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Seed script (`prisma/seed.ts`) should be robust: handle cases where the user is not found, or `ADMIN_EMAIL` is not set.
  - Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`):
    - Should clearly define which paths it protects (e.g., using `matcher` config or conditional logic based on `request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')`).
    - Logic: Get token/session, check for `token.roles.includes(Role.ADMIN)`. If not, `NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))` or similar.
    - Remember to import `Role` enum from `@prisma/client` in middleware if comparing roles.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test the Prisma seed script logic (if complex enough to warrant unit testing parts of it, though often it's tested by execution).
  - Test the middleware logic: Mock `getToken` or `getServerSession` to simulate different user roles (admin, non-admin, unauthenticated) and verify redirection behavior.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Not typically the focus for middleware or seed scripts, but E2E covers the outcome.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Scenario 1 (Admin Access):
    1. (Setup) Ensure a user exists and run the seed script to make them an admin.
    2. Log in as the admin user.
    3. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`. Verify access is granted and placeholder content is visible.
  - Scenario 2 (Non-Admin Access):
    1. (Setup) Ensure a user exists with only `USER` role.
    2. Log in as the non-admin user.
    3. Attempt to navigate to `/admin/dashboard`. Verify redirection (e.g., to login or homepage).
  - Scenario 3 (Unauthenticated Access):
    1. Attempt to navigate to `/admin/dashboard` without being logged in. Verify redirection (e.g., to login page).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1: Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` to an existing user. Run `npx prisma db seed`. Check DB to confirm `ADMIN` role is added. Test with a non-existent email. Test without `ADMIN_EMAIL` set.
  - Verify AC2: Log in as admin, navigate to `/admin/dashboard`.
  - Verify AC3: Log in as non-admin, attempt to navigate to `/admin/dashboard`. Try as unauthenticated user.
  - Verify AC4: Check content of `/admin/dashboard` when accessed as admin.

## Tasks / Subtasks

(Developer agent to break down further and check off as implemented)
- [x] Create/Update `prisma/seed.ts`:
  - [x] Read `ADMIN_EMAIL` from `process.env`.
  - [x] If `ADMIN_EMAIL` is set, find user by email.
  - [x] If user found, update `user.roles` to include `Role.ADMIN` (avoid duplicates). Log success/failure.
  - [x] Add error handling (e.g., `ADMIN_EMAIL` not set, user not found).
- [x] Update `package.json` `prisma.seed` script if needed (e.g., `"prisma:seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"` or using `dotenv-cli` if direct `process.env` access in seed needs it).
- [x] Document seed script usage (env var, command) in `README.md` or as comments in `prisma/seed.ts`.
- [x] Create `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` with simple placeholder content (e.g., "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard").
- [x] Modify `src/middleware.ts`:
  - [x] Add `matcher: ['/admin/:path*']` or equivalent path checking logic.
  - [x] Import `Role` from `@prisma/client`.
  - [x] Get user token/session (e.g., using `getToken` from `next-auth/jwt`).
  - [x] Check if `token?.roles?.includes(Role.ADMIN)`.
  - [x] If not admin or no token, redirect to login page (`new URL('/login', request.url)`).
- [x] Write unit tests for middleware logic.
- [x] Perform manual verification of all ACs.
- [ ] (Recommended) Write E2E tests for admin route access scenarios.

## Deviations from Epic
*(To be filled if any deviations from `docs/epic1.md` are necessary during implementation)*
- Seed script will use an environment variable `ADMIN_EMAIL` for flexibility, as suggested by good practice for such scripts.
