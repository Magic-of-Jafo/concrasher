# Story 1.7: Application for Organizer Role & Self-Activation for Talent Role

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal (Organizer):** As a logged-in "User/Hobbyist", I want to submit an application to become an "Organizer", so that an Admin can review my request and grant me additional platform privileges for managing conventions.

**User Story / Goal (Talent):** As a logged-in "User/Hobbyist" or "Organizer", I want to self-activate Talent status through a setting in my profile, so I can create and manage a Talent Profile without needing admin approval.

**Context:** This story builds upon the user authentication, profile, and role systems established in Stories 1.1-1.6. It introduces two distinct mechanisms for users to acquire specialized roles: a formal application process for the `ORGANIZER` role (which requires admin approval, handled in a subsequent story), and a direct self-activation for the `TALENT` role. This involves database schema changes to support role applications.

## Detailed Requirements

**Prisma Schema Changes (in `prisma/schema.prisma`):**
- Define `RequestedRole` enum:
  ```prisma
  enum RequestedRole {
    ORGANIZER // Talent is self-activated, so only Organizer is listed here
  }
  ```
- Define `ApplicationStatus` enum:
  ```prisma
  enum ApplicationStatus {
    PENDING
    APPROVED
    REJECTED
  }
  ```
- Define `RoleApplication` model:
  ```prisma
  model RoleApplication {
    id            String            @id @default(cuid())
    userId        String
    requestedRole RequestedRole
    status        ApplicationStatus @default(PENDING)
    // message     String? // Optional: for application notes or rejection reasons

    user          User              @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

    createdAt     DateTime          @default(now())
    updatedAt     DateTime          @updatedAt

    @@unique([userId, requestedRole]) // A user can only have one pending application for a specific role
  }
  ```
- Add relation to `User` model:
  ```prisma
  // In User model
  roleApplications RoleApplication[]
  ```
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_role_application` to apply schema changes.

**Detailed Requirements (Organizer Application):**
- On the user's profile page (e.g., `/profile` or a dedicated settings sub-page), provide an option/button (e.g., "Apply for Organizer Role"). This option should only be visible if the user does not already have the `ORGANIZER` role and does not have a `PENDING` application for `ORGANIZER`.
- Clicking "apply" should:
    - Trigger a Server Action or API route.
    - Create a `RoleApplication` record in the database with `userId` (current user), `requestedRole: RequestedRole.ORGANIZER`, and `status: ApplicationStatus.PENDING`.
- User should receive feedback that their Organizer application has been submitted (e.g., a toast notification and the "Apply" button should become disabled or change text to "Application Pending").
- If an application for the `ORGANIZER` role is already `PENDING` or if the user is already an `ORGANIZER`, the apply option should be hidden or disabled.

**Detailed Requirements (Talent Self-Activation):**
- In the user's profile settings (e.g., `/profile` or a dedicated settings sub-page), provide an option (e.g., a toggle or button "Activate Talent Profile" or "Become a Talent"). This option should only be visible if the user does not already have the `TALENT` role.
- Activating this option should:
    - Trigger a Server Action or API route.
    - Programmatically add `Role.TALENT` to the `User.roles` array for that user. The update should ensure no duplicate roles are added.
- Upon successful activation, the user should be informed (e.g., a toast notification), and the UI option to activate should be hidden or indicate "Talent Role Active".
- No `RoleApplication` record is created for Talent activation.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

**ACs - Schema Changes:**
- AC1: The `RequestedRole` and `ApplicationStatus` enums are successfully added to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- AC2: The `RoleApplication` model is successfully added to `prisma/schema.prisma` with the specified fields and relations.
- AC3: The `roleApplications` relation is added to the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- AC4: Prisma migration `add_role_application` is successfully generated and applied to the database.

**ACs - Organizer Application:**
- AC5: A logged-in user (without `ORGANIZER` role and no pending `ORGANIZER` application) can find and use an option on their profile page to apply for the "Organizer" role.
- AC6: Upon application for Organizer, a `RoleApplication` record is created in the database with the correct `userId`, `requestedRole: RequestedRole.ORGANIZER`, and `status: ApplicationStatus.PENDING`.
- AC7: The user receives confirmation that their Organizer application is submitted, and the "Apply" option is appropriately updated (disabled/hidden).
- AC8: The apply option for Organizer is not available if an application for `ORGANIZER` is already pending for the user or if the user is already an `ORGANIZER`.

**ACs - Talent Self-Activation:**
- AC9: A logged-in User (without `TALENT` role) can find and use an option in their profile to self-activate Talent status.
- AC10: Upon self-activation, `Role.TALENT` is correctly added to the `User.roles` array in the database (ensuring no duplicates).
- AC11: User receives confirmation of Talent status activation, and the UI option is updated.
- AC12: The activate Talent option is not available if the user already has the `TALENT` role.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `prisma/schema.prisma`: Add new enums, model, and update User model.
    - `src/app/(main)/profile/page.tsx` (or similar existing profile page): Add UI elements for role application/activation.
    - `src/lib/actions.ts`: Add new Server Actions:
        - `applyForOrganizerRole()`
        - `activateTalentRole()`
  - Potentially new components in `src/components/features/` for the UI elements if they are complex.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Prisma (for schema changes, migrations, database interaction in Server Actions)
  - Next.js (App Router, Server Actions)
  - React (for UI components on profile page)
  - TypeScript
  - Zod (if any complex input for application forms, though not explicitly required by epic for MVP)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`) in Server Actions:
    - `db.roleApplication.create()`
    - `db.roleApplication.findFirst()` (to check for pending applications)
    - `db.user.update()` (to add `Role.TALENT`)
    - `db.user.findUnique()` (to get current user roles)
  - Auth.js: Use `auth()` or `getSession()` from `next-auth/react` (client-side) or `authOptions` with `getServerSession` (server-side in API routes if not using Server Actions) to get current `session.user.id` and `session.user.roles`. Server Actions can directly access session data via `auth()` from `src/lib/auth.ts` (if configured for Next.js 14+ App Router).

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Integrate new buttons/toggles seamlessly into the existing user profile page structure.
  - Provide clear visual feedback for actions (e.g., toast notifications for success/failure, button state changes).
  - Organizer Application:
    - Button text: "Apply for Organizer Role"
    - Disabled/Pending state: "Organizer Application Pending" or button disabled.
  - Talent Activation:
    - Toggle/Button text: "Activate Talent Profile" or "Become a Talent"
    - Active state: "Talent Role Active" or option hidden.

- **Data Structures:**
  - `RoleApplication` model as defined in requirements.
  - `User.roles` array (of `Role` enum).

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No new environment variables specific to this story are anticipated.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Server Actions in `src/lib/actions.ts` should handle all business logic and database interactions.
  - Ensure proper authorization checks in Server Actions (e.g., user must be logged in).
  - Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., database errors, user already has role).
  - For updating `User.roles`, ensure the array is correctly modified to add a new role without duplication and preserving existing roles. `user.roles.includes(Role.TALENT)` check before adding.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - For Server Actions (`applyForOrganizerRole`, `activateTalentRole`):
    - Mock Prisma client calls.
    - Test logic for creating `RoleApplication` records correctly.
    - Test logic for updating `User.roles` correctly (idempotency, no duplicates).
    - Test logic for checking existing roles/applications.
  - For any new UI components:
    - Test rendering based on user roles and application status.
    - Test button/toggle interactions and that they call the correct Server Actions.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the profile page components interacting with the Server Actions (with Prisma calls mocked or using a test DB utility).
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Scenario 1 (Organizer Application):
    1. Log in as a standard `USER`.
    2. Navigate to profile page. Verify "Apply for Organizer Role" button is visible.
    3. Click button. Verify confirmation message and button state changes.
    4. (DB Check) Verify `RoleApplication` record is created with `PENDING` status.
    5. Log out, log back in. Verify button still shows "Application Pending" or is disabled.
    6. (Optional) Test that a user who is already `ORGANIZER` does not see the button.
  - Scenario 2 (Talent Self-Activation):
    1. Log in as a standard `USER`.
    2. Navigate to profile page. Verify "Activate Talent Profile" option is visible.
    3. Click/toggle option. Verify confirmation and UI change.
    4. (DB Check) Verify `User.roles` now includes `TALENT`.
    5. Log out, log back in. Verify Talent status is reflected and option is "Active" or hidden.
    6. (Optional) Test that a user who is already `TALENT` does not see the activation option or it indicates active.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1-AC4: Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_role_application` and inspect `schema.prisma` and database structure.
  - Manually perform E2E scenarios to confirm UI and data changes.

## Deviations from Epic
*(To be filled if any deviations from `docs/epic1.md` are necessary during implementation)*
- No deviations anticipated at this stage.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`
- **Completion Notes:** Implemented Organizer role application and Talent role self-activation/deactivation. Addressed edge cases for application statuses (Pending, Approved) and role display for Admin/Organizer users. Profile page title is now dynamic based on user role. All server actions and UI components have associated unit tests. DATABASE_URL loading for Prisma CLI commands requires `dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma ...`.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial implementation of schema, server actions, UI components, and unit tests.
  - Refined Organizer application button to handle 'Approved' status correctly.
  - Enabled Talent role deactivation.
  - Hid role management section for Admin users and made profile title dynamic for Admin/Organizer roles.
