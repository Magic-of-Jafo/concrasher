# Story 1.5: User Role System - Data Models & Basic Structure

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** Technical Story - To define and implement the core database schema (using Prisma) for Users, the `Role` enum (`USER`, `ORGANIZER`, `TALENT`, `ADMIN`), and their relationships, to support multi-role assignments and role-based access control foundations.

**Context:** This technical story builds upon the user authentication (Stories 1.1-1.3) and profile management (Story 1.4). It formally establishes the role system within the database and ensures that user roles are integrated into the Auth.js session. This is a foundational step for implementing role-specific features and access controls in subsequent stories.

## Detailed Requirements

- Verify and ensure the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` includes a `roles Role[]` field with a default of `[USER]`.
- Verify and ensure the `Role` enum (`USER`, `ORGANIZER`, `TALENT`, `ADMIN`) is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Ensure database migrations reflecting this schema are up-to-date and applied successfully.
- Modify Auth.js (`src/lib/auth.ts`) callbacks (`jwt` and `session`) to include the user's `roles` array in the session object (e.g., `session.user.roles`).
- The `authorize` function in the `CredentialsProvider` in `src/lib/auth.ts` should be updated to include `roles` in the user object it returns, so roles are available to the `jwt` callback immediately upon login.
- Demonstrate (e.g., via logging or a test utility) the ability to programmatically assign and query user roles.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `prisma/schema.prisma` correctly includes the `User` model with a `roles Role[] @default([USER])` field, and the `Role` enum (`USER`, `ORGANIZER`, `TALENT`, `ADMIN`). Associated database migrations have been successfully applied.
- AC2: It is possible to programmatically assign one or more roles to a user by updating the `User.roles` array in the database (e.g., via a Prisma client update). This can be verified with a test script or a manual database update and query.
- AC3: It is possible to programmatically query the roles associated with a user (e.g., by reading `user.roles` from a Prisma client query).
- AC4: The user's `roles` array is successfully included in the Auth.js `session.user` object (e.g., as `session.user.roles`) and is accessible after login. This allows Next.js middleware or page components to check `session.user.roles` for determining user capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Verify:
    - (Verify) `prisma/schema.prisma`: Ensure `Role` enum and `User.roles` field are present and correct.
    - (Verify) Prisma migrations folder: Ensure migrations for these fields exist and apply.
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/lib/auth.ts`: Modify `authorize` function in `CredentialsProvider` and the `jwt` and `session` callbacks in `authOptions` to include user roles.
    - Potentially create a temporary test script (e.g., `scripts/test-roles.ts`) to demonstrate AC2 and AC3 if not covered by automated tests for this story.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Prisma (for schema definition, migrations, and programmatic updates to `User.roles`)
  - Auth.js (NextAuth.js `~v4.x`): Modifying session and JWT callbacks.
  - TypeScript

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`):
    - `db.user.update()` to demonstrate assigning roles (AC2).
    - `db.user.findUnique()` to demonstrate querying roles (AC3).
  - Auth.js (`src/lib/auth.ts`):
    - Modify `authorize` function to return user object including `roles`.
    - Modify `callbacks.jwt`: When `user` object is available (on sign-in), fetch/include `user.roles` from the database (if not already on `user` object from `authorize`) and add to the `token`.
    - Modify `callbacks.session`: Add `roles` from `token` to `session.user`.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Not applicable. This is a backend/data model focused story.

- **Data Structures:**
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` (ensure these are correctly defined):
    ```prisma
    enum Role {
      USER
      ORGANIZER
      TALENT
      ADMIN
    }

    model User {
      // ... other fields
      roles Role[] @default([USER])
      // ... other fields
    }
    ```
  - Auth.js session object structure (`session.user` in TypeScript):
    ```typescript
    interface SessionUser {
      id: string;
      name?: string | null;
      email?: string | null;
      image?: string | null;
      roles?: Role[]; // This is the target field to populate
    }
    ```
    (Note: The actual `NextAuthUser` type might need to be extended or an augmented type declared for `session.user` to include `roles` for type safety in the application).

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No new variables required.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Ensure Prisma schema changes (if any, though it seems mostly verification) are migrated correctly.
  - When modifying `src/lib/auth.ts`, ensure existing functionality (like `id` in session) is preserved.
  - Type safety: If extending Auth.js types for `session.user.roles`, do this in a type declaration file (e.g., `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test the modified `jwt` and `session` callbacks in `src/lib/auth.ts` (mocking user data with roles, and token data).
  - Test the modified `authorize` function to ensure it returns roles.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the login flow (`signIn`) and verify that the resulting session object (mocked or from a test utility that calls Auth.js handlers) contains the `roles`.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1: Inspect `prisma/schema.prisma`. Run `npx prisma migrate status` or `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only` (if schema is already supposedly up-to-date and you just want to ensure no new migration is generated, or `npx prisma migrate dev` if changes were needed).
  - Verify AC2 & AC3: Use `npx prisma studio` or a custom script (`scripts/test-roles.ts` using Prisma client) to:
    - Find a user.
    - Update their `roles` array (e.g., add `ADMIN`).
    - Re-fetch the user and confirm the `roles` array is updated.
    - Set roles back to original for cleanliness if needed.
  - Verify AC4: After logging in as a user (whose roles you might have manually set for testing), inspect the session object (e.g., via a test API endpoint that returns `getServerSession()` or client-side `useSession()`) to confirm `session.user.roles` is populated correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

(Developer agent to break down further and check off as implemented)
- [x] Verify `Role` enum and `User.roles Role[] @default([USER])` field in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- [x] Ensure Prisma migrations are up-to-date. If schema changes were needed from prior stories and not migrated, run `npx prisma migrate dev`.
- [x] Modify `CredentialsProvider.authorize` function in `src/lib/auth.ts` to fetch and return the user's `roles` as part of the user object.
- [x] Modify `callbacks.jwt` in `src/lib/auth.ts`:
  - [x] If `user` object (from `authorize` or adapter) is present and has `roles`, add `token.roles = user.roles`.
  - [x] If `user` is present but `roles` are not on it (e.g., for OAuth users later, or if adapter doesn't include it), and it's the first time JWT is created for user, fetch `user.roles` from DB: `const dbUser = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: token.sub || user.id } }); token.roles = dbUser?.roles;`
- [x] Modify `callbacks.session` in `src/lib/auth.ts` to assign `session.user.roles = token.roles as Role[]` (or similar, with type assertion).
- [x] Create a type declaration file (e.g., `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`) to extend the `Session` and `User` interfaces from `next-auth` to include the `roles` field for improved type safety across the application.
  ```typescript
  // src/types/next-auth.d.ts
  import { Role } from '@prisma/client'; // Assuming Role enum is exported or accessible
  import NextAuth, { DefaultSession, DefaultUser } from 'next-auth';
  import { JWT as DefaultJWT } from "next-auth/jwt";

  declare module 'next-auth' {
    interface Session extends DefaultSession {
      user?: {
        id: string;
        roles?: Role[];
      } & DefaultSession['user'];
    }

    interface User extends DefaultUser {
      roles?: Role[];
    }
  }

  declare module "next-auth/jwt" {
    interface JWT extends DefaultJWT {
      roles?: Role[];
      id?: string; // ensure id is also part of JWT if used from token.id
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] (Optional but recommended for AC2/AC3 verification if not part of unit tests) Create a test script `scripts/test-user-roles.ts` to demonstrate programmatic assignment and querying of user roles.
- [x] Write unit tests for the modified Auth.js callbacks and `authorize` function.
- [x] Perform manual verification of all ACs, especially inspecting the session object after login.

## Deviations from Epic
*(To be filled if any deviations from `docs/epic1.md` are necessary during implementation)*
- The `prisma/schema.prisma` already contains the `Role` enum and `User.roles` field from previous setup. This story focuses on verification and integration into Auth.js session. This is an elaboration rather than a deviation.
