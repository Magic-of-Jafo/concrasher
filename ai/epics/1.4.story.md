# Story 1.4: User Profile - Basic View & Edit

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view my basic profile information and edit some of it (e.g., display name, a short bio), so that I can personalize my presence on the platform.

**Context:** This story follows Story 1.3 (User Login & Logout), where users gained the ability to authenticate. Story 1.4 allows these authenticated users to manage their own basic profile information (display name and bio), enhancing personalization and user engagement. It requires fetching current user data and providing a secure way to update it.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a user profile page (e.g., `/profile`) accessible only to logged-in users.
- Display basic user information on this page: email (read-only), current display name, and current bio.
- Provide an editable form on the profile page for users to update their display name and bio.
- Validate the form input using a Zod schema (e.g., `ProfileSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts`).
- Save changes to the user's `name` and `bio` fields in the database using a Server Action and Prisma.
- Ensure that only the authenticated user can edit their own profile. Authorization checks must compare the session user's ID against the ID of the profile being edited.
- After a successful update, display a success message and reflect the changes on the profile page.
- If the `bio` field does not exist on the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`, it needs to be added (`bio String?`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A logged-in user can navigate to their profile page (e.g., `/profile`) and view their current email (non-editable), display name, and bio.
- AC2: A user can successfully update their display name and/or bio using an edit form on the profile page. Input must be validated by a Zod schema (`ProfileSchema`).
- AC3: Changes made to the display name and bio are persisted in the `User` record in the database (via Prisma through a Server Action) and are reflected on the profile page after a successful update.
- AC4: An attempt by an unauthenticated user to access the `/profile` page is redirected (e.g., to the login page).
- AC5: The Server Action performing the update must verify that the session user's ID matches the ID of the user whose profile is being updated.
- AC6: The `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` includes a `bio String?` field, and migrations are successfully applied.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/app/(main)/profile/page.tsx` (Profile page UI, displays user data and includes the edit form component).
    - `src/components/features/ProfileForm.tsx` (React component for the profile edit form).
  - Files to Modify:
    - `prisma/schema.prisma`: Add `bio String?` to the `User` model if it doesn't exist. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` afterwards.
    - `src/lib/validators.ts`: Add `ProfileSchema` for validating `name` (display name) and `bio`.
    - `src/lib/actions.ts`: Add a new Server Action (e.g., `updateUserProfile`) to handle profile data updates. This action will use Prisma to update the `User` record and must perform authorization checks.
    - Potentially `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` or similar to ensure a navigation link to `/profile` is available for logged-in users (as per `docs/ui-ux.md` which mentions a User Profile Dropdown/Link).

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js (App Router, Server Components for display, Client Components for the form, Server Actions for mutations)
  - React (for UI components, state management for the form)
  - Prisma (to update `User` model in the database via `src/lib/db.ts`)
  - Zod (for `ProfileSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts`)
  - Auth.js (NextAuth.js `~v4.x`): `getServerSession(authOptions)` from `src/lib/auth.ts` to get current user data and ID for display and authorization in Server Components and Server Actions.
  - Material UI (MUI) (for profile page layout, form components, feedback messages).

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`): `db.user.update()` within the Server Action to save profile changes.
  - Auth.js: `getServerSession(authOptions)` to retrieve `session.user.id` and current profile data (`session.user.name`, `session.user.email`). Note: `session.user.bio` won't be available until after the first update if `bio` is a new field; the page should fetch the full user record initially.
  - Zod: For `ProfileSchema` definition and validation within the Server Action and potentially client-side in `ProfileForm.tsx`.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - The `/profile` page should display the user's email (read-only), display name, and bio.
  - Include an edit form (`ProfileForm.tsx`) that allows modification of display name and bio.
  - Use MUI components for the form fields (TextFields for name and bio) and submit button.
  - Provide clear success messages (e.g., using MUI Snackbar/Alert) upon successful update.
  - Provide clear error messages if validation fails or if the update operation fails.
  - The navigation to this page should be clear for a logged-in user (e.g., from a user menu in the header).

- **Data Structures:**
  - `User` model update in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
    ```prisma
    model User {
      // ... existing fields
      name          String?   // Display name
      bio           String?   // Short biography
      // ... existing fields
    }
    ```
  - `ProfileSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts` (e.g., for `name: z.string().optional(), bio: z.string().max(200).optional()`). Define appropriate constraints.
  - Server Action payload: e.g., `{ name?: string, bio?: string }`.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No new variables are required. Uses existing `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - The Server Action in `src/lib/actions.ts` is critical. It must:
    - Get the current `session` using `getServerSession(authOptions)`.
    - If no session, throw an authentication error.
    - Validate input data using `ProfileSchema`.
    - Update the `User` record using `db.user.update({ where: { id: session.user.id }, data: { ... } })`.
    - Revalidate path (`revalidatePath('/profile')`) if using Server Components to display profile data, to ensure fresh data is shown.
  - Ensure the profile page (`src/app/(main)/profile/page.tsx`) fetches the latest user data on load, potentially directly from the database using Prisma and the user ID from the session, to ensure it has the `bio` field if newly added.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `ProfileSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts` with various valid and invalid inputs.
  - Test the `updateUserProfile` Server Action (in `src/lib/actions.ts`):
    - Mock Prisma calls (`db.user.update`).
    - Mock `getServerSession` to simulate logged-in and logged-out states.
    - Test successful update, validation errors, and authorization failures.
  - Test `ProfileForm.tsx` component: rendering, input changes, client-side validation (if any), and calling the Server Action (mocked).
  - Test `src/app/(main)/profile/page.tsx`: rendering of user data (mocked session/user data).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test interaction between `ProfileForm.tsx` and the actual `updateUserProfile` Server Action (mocking Prisma and session at the action level).
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Logged-in user navigates to `/profile`, views current data, successfully edits name and bio, verifies changes are saved and displayed.
  - Attempt to edit profile with invalid data (e.g., bio too long if max length is set), verify error messages.
  - Unauthenticated user attempts to access `/profile`, verify redirection to login.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1: Navigate to profile, view data.
  - Verify AC2: Update name/bio, check form validation.
  - Verify AC3: Confirm data persistence in DB and on page.
  - Verify AC4: Test unauthenticated access to `/profile`.
  - Verify AC5: Review Server Action code for auth check.
  - Verify AC6: Check `prisma/schema.prisma` for `bio` field; run `npx prisma db pull` (if needed) and `npx prisma migrate dev` (after adding field), confirm migrations apply.

## Deviations from Epic
*(To be filled if any deviations from `docs/epic1.md` are necessary during implementation)*
- Explicitly adding `bio: String?` to the `User` model is a necessary clarification/addition based on detailed requirements.
