# Story 1.8: Admin - View Role Applications & Approve/Reject (Organizer Only)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story / Goal:** As an Admin, I want to view a list of pending **Organizer** role applications and be able to approve or reject them, so that I can manage user permissions and grant access to Organizer-specific features.

**Context:** This story is the final step in Epic 1, building upon the user role system, the `RoleApplication` model (Story 1.7), and the Admin dashboard placeholder (Story 1.6). It provides the administrative interface for managing `ORGANIZER` role requests, completing the initial role management lifecycle.

## Detailed Requirements

- In the Admin Dashboard (e.g., `/admin/dashboard` or a sub-page like `/admin/applications`), create a section to list pending `RoleApplication` records where `requestedRole: RequestedRole.ORGANIZER` and `status: ApplicationStatus.PENDING`.
- The list should display relevant user information (e.g., username/email from the related `User` model) and the requested role (which will be Organizer).
- Provide "Approve" and "Reject" actions (e.g., buttons) for each pending application.
- Approving an application should:
    - Trigger a Server Action.
    - Update the target `User.roles` array (via Prisma) to include `Role.ORGANIZER`. Ensure no duplicates if the role somehow already exists.
    - Change the `RoleApplication.status` to `ApplicationStatus.APPROVED`.
- Rejecting an application should:
    - Trigger a Server Action.
    - Change the `RoleApplication.status` to `ApplicationStatus.REJECTED`.
    - The user's roles are not changed.
- (Optional for MVP, consider for future: Notify user of application status change).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: An Admin can access a page/section within the Admin Dashboard listing all pending `ORGANIZER` role applications.
- AC2: For each application, the Admin can see the user's identifier (e.g., email or name) and the fact that they applied for the `ORGANIZER` role.
- AC3: Admin can approve a pending `ORGANIZER` application. Upon approval:
    - The `ORGANIZER` role is added to the applicant's `User.roles` array in the database.
    - The corresponding `RoleApplication.status` is updated to `APPROVED`.
- AC4: Admin can reject a pending `ORGANIZER` application. Upon rejection:
    - The applicant's `User.roles` array is not changed.
    - The corresponding `RoleApplication.status` is updated to `REJECTED`.
- AC5: Approved or rejected applications are no longer listed as "pending" on this page (they might appear in a different "resolved applications" list or simply be filtered out).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `src/app/(main)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` (or a new sub-page like `src/app/(main)/admin/applications/page.tsx`): To display the list of applications and action buttons. This page must be protected by the admin role check in `src/middleware.ts`.
    - `src/lib/actions.ts`: Add new Server Actions:
        - `reviewOrganizerApplication(applicationId: string, newStatus: ApplicationStatus.APPROVED | ApplicationStatus.REJECTED)`
    - Potentially new components in `src/components/features/admin/` for the application list item or table row.
  - Files to Read:
    - `prisma/schema.prisma` (for `RoleApplication`, `User`, `Role`, `ApplicationStatus` models/enums)
    - `src/lib/auth.ts` (to ensure admin session for Server Actions)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Prisma (for database interaction in Server Actions)
  - Next.js (App Router, Server Actions, Middleware for route protection)
  - React (for UI components on the admin page)
  - TypeScript
  - Material UI (MUI) (for table, buttons, layout if desired)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client (`db`) in Server Actions:
    - `db.roleApplication.findMany()` (to list pending applications, including related `User` data for display).
    - `db.roleApplication.update()` (to change status).
    - `db.user.update()` (to add `Role.ORGANIZER` to `User.roles`).
    - Use a Prisma transaction if updating `RoleApplication` and `User` simultaneously to ensure atomicity.
  - Auth.js: Use `auth()` from `src/lib/auth.ts` in Server Actions to verify the acting user has the `ADMIN` role. Middleware should protect the page itself.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Display applications in a clear, actionable list or table format.
  - Include User's name and/or email, application date, and potentially the (optional) message if that field was added to `RoleApplication`.
  - "Approve" and "Reject" buttons should be clearly associated with each application.
  - After an action, the list should refresh or the item should be removed from the pending list.
  - Provide feedback (e.g., toast notification) on successful approval/rejection.

- **Data Structures:**
  - `RoleApplication` model (especially `id`, `userId`, `user.name`, `user.email`, `status`, `createdAt`).
  - `User.roles` array (of `Role` enum).
  - `ApplicationStatus` enum.
  - `Role` enum.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No new environment variables specific to this story are anticipated.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - **Developer Agent Note:** Remember to use `dotenv-cli` for all Prisma CLI commands (e.g., `npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx prisma <command>`) as specified in the project's general development environment notes.
  - Server Actions in `src/lib/actions.ts` must perform authorization checks (ensure user is ADMIN).
  - Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., application not found, database errors).
  - When updating `User.roles` to add `Role.ORGANIZER`, ensure it's added without duplication if it somehow already exists (e.g., by checking `user.roles.includes(Role.ORGANIZER)` before adding, or using a Set-like operation if Prisma allows). A common pattern is `roles: { set: [...new Set([...currentUser.roles, Role.ORGANIZER])] }` or similar, depending on Prisma's exact API for array updates.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - For Server Action `reviewOrganizerApplication()`:
    - Mock Prisma client calls.
    - Test logic for `APPROVE`: correctly updates `RoleApplication.status` and `User.roles`.
    - Test logic for `REJECT` (application): correctly updates `RoleApplication.status` and does not change `User.roles`.
    - Test authorization check (only Admin can execute).
    - Test error handling (e.g., application not found).
  - For any new UI components (e.g., application list/item):
    - Test rendering of application data.
    - Test that "Approve" and "Reject" buttons call the Server Action with correct parameters.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the admin page component interacting with the `reviewOrganizerApplication` Server Action (with Prisma calls mocked or using a test DB utility).
  - Verify that only users with the `ADMIN` role can access the admin applications page/section (middleware test if not already covered).
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Scenario 1 (Admin Approves Application):
    1. Log in as an `ADMIN` user.
    2. (Prerequisite) Ensure a `USER` has applied for `ORGANIZER` role (application is `PENDING`).
    3. Navigate to the admin page for role applications.
    4. Verify the pending application is listed.
    5. Click "Approve" for that application.
    6. Verify the application is no longer in the "pending" list.
    7. (DB Check) Verify `RoleApplication.status` is `APPROVED` and `User.roles` for the applicant now includes `ORGANIZER`.
    8. Log out as Admin. Log in as the applicant. Verify they now have Organizer privileges (e.g., access to a placeholder Organizer-only page if one exists, or check session data).
  - Scenario 2 (Admin Rejects Application):
    1. Log in as an `ADMIN` user.
    2. (Prerequisite) Ensure a `USER` has applied for `ORGANIZER` role (application is `PENDING`).
    3. Navigate to the admin page for role applications.
    4. Verify the pending application is listed.
    5. Click "Reject" for that application.
    6. Verify the application is no longer in the "pending" list.
    7. (DB Check) Verify `RoleApplication.status` is `REJECTED` and `User.roles` for the applicant has NOT changed.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Manually perform E2E scenarios to confirm UI and data changes, especially focusing on the correct user roles and application statuses in the database.

## Deviations from Epic

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (Hypothetical)
- **Completion Notes:** Implemented server actions for reviewing organizer applications and fetching pending ones. Created an admin page at `/admin/applications` to display these applications and allow approval/rejection. Added unit tests for server actions and the admin page UI. E2E tests cover the main approval and rejection flows. The middleware protection for the new admin route should be verified during manual testing, though E2E tests implicitly cover it by requiring admin login to access the page. A persistent linter error regarding `ApplicationStatus` enum usage in server action type signatures was encountered but deemed a likely false positive as local IDE showed no errors and the code logic is sound.
