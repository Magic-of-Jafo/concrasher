# Story 1.3: User Login & Logout (Email/Password)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in to the platform using my email and password, and log out when I'm done, so that I can securely access my account and protected features.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 1.2 (Basic User Registration), where users were able to create accounts with email and hashed passwords. Story 1.3 implements the core login and logout functionality using Auth.js, enabling users to access authenticated sessions and paving the way for role-based access control and personalized features.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a login page (e.g., `/login`) with fields for email and password.
- Validate user credentials against stored (hashed) passwords using the Auth.js credential provider.
- Implement session management using Auth.js (with the PrismaAdapter, resulting in database sessions) upon successful login.
- Provide a clear way for users to log out (e.g., a logout button), which clears their session.
- Redirect users appropriately after login (e.g., to a dashboard or homepage) and logout (e.g., to homepage).
- Implement client-side and server-side validation for login input fields using Zod schemas (to be defined in `src/lib/validators.ts`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A registered user can successfully log in with correct email and password via the `/login` page.
- AC2: An attempt to log in with incorrect credentials (wrong email, wrong password, or non-existent user) results in a clear error message on the login page, and no session is created.
- AC3: Upon successful login, a user session is established (e.g., session cookie set by Auth.js, session record created in the database via Auth.js PrismaAdapter) and maintained across page navigations.
- AC4: A logged-in user can successfully log out using a visible logout mechanism (e.g., button in header/profile menu).
- AC5: Upon logout, the user's session is terminated (session cookie cleared by Auth.js, session record invalidated/removed from database if applicable by PrismaAdapter behavior).
- AC6: Users are redirected to an appropriate page after successful login (e.g., `/dashboard` or `/`) and after logout (e.g., `/`).
- AC7: Login form inputs (email, password) are validated client-side and server-side using a Zod schema (e.g., `LoginSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts`).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (Login page UI and form handling)
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/lib/auth.ts`: Update the `authorize` function within the `CredentialsProvider` to validate credentials against the database (Prisma) and compare hashed passwords (using `bcryptjs`).
    - `src/lib/validators.ts`: Add a `LoginSchema` for validating login form data (email, password).
    - Potentially `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` or a similar shared UI component to add a "Logout" button and display user session status (e.g., "Logged in as [email/name]").
    - Potentially `src/middleware.ts` if specific redirect logic post-login needs to be handled there, or to protect routes that require authentication.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions or Client Components for form handling)
  - React (for UI components, state management for the form)
  - Auth.js (NextAuth.js `~v4.x`): `signIn`, `signOut` functions, `useSession` hook (client-side) or `getServerSession` (server-side).
  - Prisma (via `db` client, used by `PrismaAdapter` and potentially in `authorize` function)
  - Zod (for login form validation)
  - `bcryptjs` (for comparing hashed passwords in the `authorize` function)
  - Material UI (MUI) (for login form components, buttons, feedback messages)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Auth.js:
    - `signIn('credentials', { email, password, redirect: false })` for submitting login credentials.
    - `signOut()` for logging out.
    - `useSession()` hook (client components) or `getServerSession(authOptions)` (server components/actions/route handlers) to access session data.
  - Prisma Client (`db`): Used within the `authorize` function in `src/lib/auth.ts` to fetch user by email.
  - `bcryptjs`: `compare(password, hashedPassword)` function.
  - Zod: For `LoginSchema` definition and validation.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - Create a simple login form on `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` with fields for Email and Password, and a Submit button.
  - Display clear error messages for invalid credentials or other login failures directly on the form.
  - The logout mechanism should be easily accessible to logged-in users (e.g., in a site header or user dropdown menu).
  - Refer to `docs/ui-ux.md` for general navigation and page structure. No specific mockups for login are provided, so a standard, clean MUI form is expected.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Login Form Data (client-side and server-side): `{ email: string, password: string }`
  - Zod Schema in `src/lib/validators.ts` (e.g., `LoginSchema`) to validate this structure.
  - `User` model (from `prisma/schema.prisma` as per `docs/data-models.md`):
    ```prisma
    model User {
      id             String    @id @default(cuid())
      email          String?   @unique
      hashedPassword String?
      // ... other fields and relations
    }
    ```
  - Session data managed by Auth.js will include user `id`, `name`, `email`.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for dev)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (must be set)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (for Prisma)
  (These should already be configured as per Story 1.1 and `docs/environment-vars.md`.)

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Implement client-side validation (React form handling with Zod) and rely on Auth.js `CredentialsProvider` `authorize` function for server-side validation of credentials.
  - Ensure password comparison is secure using `bcryptjs`.
  - Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., user not found, incorrect password).
  - Secure logout: Ensure `signOut()` is properly called.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `LoginSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts` with valid and invalid inputs.
  - Test the updated `authorize` function in `src/lib/auth.ts` (requires mocking Prisma and bcryptjs):
    - With correct credentials for an existing user.
    - With incorrect password for an existing user.
    - With an email that does not exist in the database.
  - Test the login UI component (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`):
    - Rendering of form elements.
    - Client-side validation messages with Zod.
    - Interaction with `signIn` function (mocked).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the login flow: submit form, mock `signIn` to return success/failure, verify UI changes or redirects.
  - Test session retrieval using mocked Auth.js (`useSession` or `getServerSession`).
  - (If applicable) Test API routes or Server Actions involved if not directly using Auth.js `signIn`.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Full user flow: Navigate to `/login`, enter valid credentials of a pre-existing user (created via seed or prior test step), verify successful login and redirection.
  - Full user flow: Attempt login with invalid credentials, verify error message and no redirection.
  - Full user flow: Log in, then log out, verify successful logout and redirection.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1: Successfully log in.
  - Verify AC2: Test incorrect credentials, see error.
  - Verify AC3: Check browser cookies for session; check database `Session` table (if `strategy: 'database'` is used effectively with PrismaAdapter).
  - Verify AC4: Successfully log out.
  - Verify AC5: Check session cookie is cleared; check database `Session` table.
  - Verify AC6: Confirm redirections.
  - Verify AC7: Test form validation (client-side).

## Tasks / Subtasks

(Developer agent to break down further and check off as implemented)
- [x] Define `LoginSchema` in `src/lib/validators.ts` for email and password.
- [x] Update `CredentialsProvider.authorize` function in `src/lib/auth.ts`:
  - [x] Fetch user by email from database (Prisma).
  - [x] If user exists and has `hashedPassword`, compare provided password with `hashedPassword` using `bcryptjs`.
  - [x] Return user object if valid, else return `null` or `Error` for Auth.js to handle.
- [x] Create the login page component `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`:
  - [x] Build login form with Email, Password fields and Submit button (using MUI components).
  - [x] Implement client-side form handling and validation using `react-hook-form` (or similar) and Zod (`LoginSchema`).
  - [x] On submit, call `signIn('credentials', { email, password, redirect: false, callbackUrl: '/' })`. Handle response to show errors or redirect on success.
- [x] Implement logout functionality:
  - [x] Add a "Logout" button in a shared component (e.g., `Header.tsx` or a user dropdown).
  - [x] On click, call `signOut({ callbackUrl: '/' })`.
- [x] Ensure appropriate UI feedback for login success, errors, and logout.
- [x] Configure redirects:
  - [x] After successful login (e.g., to user dashboard or homepage). Auth.js `signIn` `callbackUrl` can handle this.
  - [x] After logout (e.g., to homepage). Auth.js `signOut` `callbackUrl` can handle this.
- [x] Write unit tests for `LoginSchema`.
- [x] Write unit tests for the `authorize` function (mocking dependencies).
- [x] Write unit/integration tests for the login page component.
- [x] Perform manual verification of all ACs (AC3.3 not met).
- [ ] (Optional, but recommended) Write E2E tests for login and logout flows.

## Deviations from Epic
*(To be filled if any deviations from `docs/epic1.md` are necessary during implementation)*
- None identified at draft stage.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`
- **Completion Notes:** All primary development tasks and automated tests as per the story file have been implemented. Manual verification confirmed ACs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are met. AC3.3 (database session records for CredentialsProvider) is not met due to NextAuth.js v4 limitations, as `CredentialsProvider` requires JWT sessions, which was prioritized for core login functionality.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft 
  - Updated status to In-Progress, added LoginSchema, updated authorize function, created login page, created header with logout, configured UI feedback and redirects, wrote unit tests for LoginSchema, authorize function, and login page component. Updated status to Review.
