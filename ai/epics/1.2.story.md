# Story 1.2: Basic User Registration (Email/Password)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new visitor, I want to register for a "User/Hobbyist" account using my email and a password, so that I can access basic platform features and content.

**Context:** This story builds upon the foundational project setup in Story 1.1 (Project Scaffolding & Local Development Environment Setup), which established the Next.js application, Prisma, and basic Auth.js configuration. Story 1.2 implements the first interactive feature for users: creating an account via email and password. This is a critical step towards enabling user-specific functionality on the platform.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a registration page with fields for email, password, and password confirmation.
- Implement client-side and server-side validation for input fields using Zod schemas (as defined in `src/lib/validators.ts`).
- Securely hash passwords using algorithms supported by Auth.js (e.g., bcrypt) before storing them.
- Upon successful registration, create a new user record in the database (via Prisma) with a default role of `Role.USER` (from Prisma `Role` enum defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Provide appropriate feedback to the user on success or failure of registration.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A user can navigate to the registration page (e.g., `/register`).
- AC2: A user can successfully submit the registration form with valid email and matching passwords, validated by Zod schemas from `src/lib/validators.ts`.
- AC3: A new user record is created in the database with the provided email (hashed password) and default `Role.USER`.
- AC4: User receives clear error messages for invalid input (e.g., email already exists based on database check via Prisma, passwords don't match, invalid email format or password complexity rules as defined by Zod schema).
- AC5: Upon successful registration, the user is redirected (e.g., to login page or a welcome page).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` (Registration page UI, following project structure for auth-related pages)
    - `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (API route for handling registration submission, if not using Server Actions directly from the page)
    - `src/lib/validators.ts` (if not already created; define Zod schema for registration form: email, password, confirmPassword)
  - Files to Modify:
    - Potentially `src/lib/auth.ts` if custom logic needs to be integrated with Auth.js, though direct use of Prisma and password hashing libraries (like bcrypt, often handled by Auth.js utilities or directly) is more likely.
    - `prisma/schema.prisma`: Ensure `User` model has `hashedPassword` field and `Role` enum is defined (as per Story 1.1 context and `docs/data-models.md`).

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions or API Routes)
  - React (for UI components)
  - Prisma (for database interaction - creating User record)
  - Zod (for input validation)
  - bcrypt (or similar, for password hashing - often Auth.js provides utilities or guidance)
  - Auth.js (for understanding how password hashing integrates, though this story is pre-login)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Prisma Client: To create `User` record.
  - Zod: For schema definition and validation.
  - Password Hashing Library (e.g., `bcryptjs`): To hash passwords before saving. `Auth.js` itself might offer utilities or guidance, or a library like `bcryptjs` can be used directly if `Auth.js` doesn't handle this part of the registration flow itself.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - A simple form with fields for Email, Password, and Confirm Password is required.
  - Clear visual feedback for validation errors and success/failure messages should be implemented.
  - `docs/ui-ux.md` has been reviewed. It confirms the need for a registration page and flow, but does not provide specific mockups for this simple form. For this story, a standard, clean registration form using MUI components (as per `docs/tech-stack.md`) is expected.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Registration Form Data (client-side and server-side): `{ email: string, password: string, confirmPassword: string }`
  - Zod Schema in `src/lib/validators.ts` (e.g., `RegistrationSchema`) to validate this structure, including password complexity rules (e.g., min length) and matching passwords.
  - `User` model (from `prisma/schema.prisma` and `docs/data-models.md`):
    ```prisma
    model User {
      id             String    @id @default(cuid())
      // ... other fields like name, emailVerified, image
      email          String?   @unique
      hashedPassword String?   // Store hashed password
      roles          Role[]    @default([USER]) // Default role
      // ... Auth.js relations
      createdAt      DateTime  @default(now())
      updatedAt      DateTime  @updatedAt
    }

    enum Role {
      USER
      ORGANIZER
      TALENT
      ADMIN
    }
    ```

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No new environment variables are specifically required for this story beyond what's defined in `docs/environment-vars.md` for general app operation (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Implement client-side validation (React form handling with Zod) and server-side validation (in API route or Server Action with Zod).
  - Ensure passwords are not logged or exposed.
  - API route/Server Action for registration should handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., email already exists).
  - File naming: `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`, `src/lib/validators.ts`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test Zod validation schema for registration form (`src/lib/validators.ts`) with various valid and invalid inputs.
  - Test any utility functions created for password hashing (if not using a library function directly).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the registration API route (`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`) or Server Action:
    - With valid data: ensure a user is created in the test database and a success response is returned.
    - With invalid data (e.g., email already exists, passwords don't match, invalid format): ensure appropriate error responses are returned and no user is created.
    - Ensure password hashing is performed.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify AC1: Navigate to the registration page.
  - Verify AC2: Test form submission with valid and invalid data (check client-side validation messages).
  - Verify AC3: After successful submission, check the database to confirm user creation with `Role.USER` and a hashed password.
  - Verify AC4: Test various error scenarios (duplicate email, mismatched passwords, weak password if rules are set) and check for clear error messages.
  - Verify AC5: Confirm redirection after successful registration.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Gemini Pro`
- **Completion Notes:** Successfully implemented user registration with email and password. Key challenges included resolving package version incompatibilities (Next.js, React, NextAuth.js, ESLint) and ensuring Prisma Studio could correctly access the DATABASE_URL (requiring the use of `dotenv-cli` for `npx prisma studio` in the user's environment). All ACs are now met. Login functionality is out of scope for this story. The initial hydration error appears resolved.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Development and testing complete, all ACs verified.
