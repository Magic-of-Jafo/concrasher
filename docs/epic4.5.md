## Epic 4.5 Brand Profile Ownership & Multi-User Management

To enable a user to create a Brand Profile they own, assign other users as managers with specific permissions, and securely transfer ownership, ensuring brands can be managed by teams and persist beyond a single user's account.

### Story 4.5.1 Foundational Brand Creation and Ownership

As a User,
I want to create a new Brand Profile,
so that I am established as its sole Owner and can begin building its identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: A user can access and submit a "Create Brand" form with a unique name and other required details.
- 2: Upon successful creation, a new `Brand` record is created in the database.
- 3: The `ownerId` field on the new `Brand` record is populated with the ID of the user who created it.
- 4: A corresponding record is created in a `BrandUser` link table, associating the creating user with the new brand and assigning them the role of `OWNER`.

### Story 4.5.2 Brand Team Management

As a Brand Owner,
I want to invite and manage other users as Managers for my Brand,
so that I can delegate the task of updating the brand's public profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: The Brand Owner can access a "Manage Team" interface for brands they own.
- 2: The Owner can use this interface to invite an existing registered user to the Brand by email or username.
- 3: The invited user receives a notification and must accept the invitation to join the Brand.
- 4: Upon acceptance, the user is added to the `BrandUser` link table with the role of `MANAGER`.
- 5: Users with the `MANAGER` role have permission to edit the Brand's public-facing information (e.g., description, images).
- 6: Users with the `MANAGER` role cannot access the "Manage Team" interface or initiate an ownership transfer.

### Story 4.5.3 Brand Ownership Transfer

As a Brand Owner,
I want to securely transfer my ownership of a Brand to another user,
so that the Brand's continuity is ensured if I sell the business or change roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: The Brand Owner can initiate an "Transfer Ownership" process from within the "Manage Team" interface.
- 2: The Owner can only select a user who is currently a `MANAGER` of that Brand to be the new owner.
- 3: A final confirmation step is required before the ownership transfer is executed.
- 4: Upon confirmation, the `Brand` record's `ownerId` is updated to the new owner's user ID.
- 5: The `BrandUser` link table is updated: the new owner's role is changed to `OWNER`, and the previous owner's role is changed to `MANAGER`.
- 6: The new Owner immediately gains all ownership privileges, including the ability to manage the team and perform future ownership transfers.
