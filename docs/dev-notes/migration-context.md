### 🧠 **Context: Moving Local Postgres DB (Docker) from Old Laptop to New**

We're migrating a local development environment, including a Dockerized Postgres DB, from an **old laptop** to a **new one**, using a **shared Synology folder** (`TeamFolder`) to keep project files in sync across devices.

---

### ✅ **What We've Done So Far**

1.  **Postgres Docker Container**

    *   On the **old laptop**, a container `agile_test-postgres-1` was running `postgres:16-alpine`.
    *   The volume used was `agile_test_postgres_data`, mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

2.  **Database SQL Dump**

    *   The `.sql` file (`conventioncrasher_dev.sql`) was dumped and saved to the shared project folder on Synology.

3.  **New Laptop Setup**

    *   Installed latest Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend.
    *   Created a **new Postgres container** with the same name, user, password, and DB name.
    *   Used `docker cp` to copy the `.sql` file into the container.
    *   Imported the `.sql` into the new container using `psql -f`.
    *   Verified success with:

        ```bash
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Convention";
        ```

        → ✅ Data is present (45 rows).

4.  **Prisma Setup**

    *   Prisma schema is defined.
    *   `.env.local` contains correct `DATABASE_URL`.
    *   We're using:

        ```bash
        npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
        ```
    *   Prisma Studio connects and sees schema, but **some Prisma commands are failing** due to file permission issues (`EPERM` on renaming `query_engine-windows.dll.node`).

---

### ❌ **Current Issue**

When running `prisma generate`, we get:

```
EPERM: operation not permitted, rename ...
node_modules\.prisma\client\query_engine-windows.dll.node.tmpXXXX → query_engine-windows.dll.node
```

> This likely indicates file locking — possibly caused by:
>
> *   IDE file watchers (e.g. VS Code or IntelliSense)
> *   Windows Defender / Antivirus
> *   Permission mismatches due to NAS mount behavior

---

### 📌 Request

Help us ensure Prisma CLI can safely write to `.prisma\client`.
We want a reliable `npx prisma generate` process under the `.env.local` environment.
