Thank you, Jafo. Based on the provided snippet, your convention listing page’s SEO metadata is mostly well-formed, but there are several important notes and improvements to ensure correctness and effectiveness—especially when using `next-seo`. Here's a structured analysis:

---

## ✅ **Well-Formed Elements**

### Title & Meta Description

* ✅ `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` are present and well-written.
* ✅ Keywords like “magic,” “convention,” and “Abbott’s Get Together” are front-loaded and relevant.

### Open Graph (OG) Tags

* ✅ `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` are included.
* ✅ These match the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`, which is consistent and good practice.

### Twitter Card Tags

* ✅ `twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, and `twitter:image` are included.
* ✅ Using `summary_large_image` is appropriate for event promotions.

---

## ❌ **Issues & Recommendations**

### 1. **Broken OG/Twitter Image URLs**

* ❌ `og:image` and `twitter:image` use a `localhost` URL:

  ```html
  <meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:10000/uploads/..." />
  ```

  **Fix:** Replace with the production URL (e.g., S3 or CDN path). Social crawlers can't access localhost.

### 2. **Incomplete JSON-LD Schema**

* ❌ Your `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag is present but incomplete (`{` without a closing brace or schema object).
  **Fix:** Properly structure this. Example for an event:

  ```json
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Event",
    "name": "Abbott's Get Together 2025",
    "startDate": "2025-08-06",
    "endDate": "2025-08-09",
    "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode",
    "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled",
    "location": {
      "@type": "Place",
      "name": "Colon, Michigan",
      "address": {
        "@type": "PostalAddress",
        "addressLocality": "Colon",
        "addressRegion": "MI",
        "addressCountry": "US"
      }
    },
    "image": [
      "https://your-production-image-url.com/cover-image-2.png"
    ],
    "description": "Four days of world-class magic, lectures, contests, and street performances...",
    "organizer": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Convention Crasher",
      "url": "https://www.conventioncrasher.com"
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. **Redundant Title**

* ❌ Title is repeated: `Abbott's Get Together 2025 | Convention Crasher | Convention Crasher`
  **Fix:** Remove duplication:

  ```
  Abbott's Get Together 2025 | Convention Crasher
  ```

### 4. **Missing Canonical Link**

* ⚠️ Best practice is to include:

  ```html
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.conventioncrasher.com/conventions/abbotts-get-together-2025" />
  ```

### 5. **Charset Tag Order**

* The `<meta charSet="utf-8" />` is correct, but ensure it's placed first inside `<head>` for spec compliance.

## ✅ **next-seo Considerations**

If you're using [`next-seo`](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo), consider managing SEO via its components like so:

```tsx
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo';

<NextSeo
  title="Abbott's Get Together 2025 | Convention Crasher"
  description="Join the 87th Abbott’s Magic Get-Together..."
  canonical="https://www.conventioncrasher.com/conventions/abbotts-get-together-2025"
  openGraph={{
    url: 'https://www.conventioncrasher.com/conventions/abbotts-get-together-2025',
    title: "Abbott's Get Together 2025 | Convention Crasher",
    description: 'Join the 87th Abbott’s Magic Get-Together...',
    images: [
      {
        url: 'https://your-production-image-url.com/cover-image-2.png',
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
        alt: 'Abbott’s Get-Together Cover Image',
      },
    ],
    site_name: 'Convention Crasher',
  }}
  twitter={{
    handle: '@conventioncrasher',
    cardType: 'summary_large_image',
  }}
/>
```

This ensures consistency, avoids redundancy, and integrates tightly with Next.js routing.
